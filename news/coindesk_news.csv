BTC 불 토큰의 현재 가격은 0.00257달러를 기록하고 있다. 수일 내 가격 상승이 예상되는 가운데, 조기 매수가 유리할 것으로 전망된다. 2. 비트코인 하이퍼 ($HYPER), 비트코인에 속도와 낮은 거래 비용을 도입 비트코인과 밈코인은 암호화폐 세계에서 로미오와 줄리엣, 또는 물과 기름과 같은 관계를 보여왔다. 두 영역은 본질적으로 결합될 수 없는 것으로 여겨졌으나, 비트코인 하이퍼($HYPER) 가 이러한 인식을 바꾸려 하고 있다. 이번 프로젝트는 실시간 확장 가능한 프로그래밍 애플리케이션을 위한 최초의 비트코인 레이어2 개발을 목표로 하고 있다. 이를 통해 비트코인 거래가 더욱 빠르고 저렴한 비용으로 이루어질 것으로 전망된다. 솔라나 가상 머신과 탈중앙화된 캐노니컬 브릿지를 통해 이러한 기능이 구현된다. 이로써 솔라나의 빠른 처리 속도와 낮은 거래 수수료가 비트코인의 타의 추종을 불허하는 보안성과 결합되는 것으로 알려졌다. 비트코인 하이퍼 팀이 프로젝트 자금 조달을 위해 $HYPER 토큰의 사전 판매를 시작했다. 해당 토큰은 L2 내 거래 및 스마트 계약 수수료 지불, DAO 의사결정 및 커뮤니티 제안 에 대한 거버넌스 권한 행사, 그리고 독점 기능 이용 등에 활용될 예정이다. 비트코인 하이퍼 프리세일 웹사이트에서 현재 $HYPER 토큰이 개당 0.011925달러에 판매되고 있다. 대부분의 프리세일 토큰과 마찬가지로, 투자자들은 수동적 수익을 얻기 위해 프로젝트의 스테이킹 풀에 토큰을 예치할 수 있는 것으로 알려졌다. 하이퍼 코인 은 2030년까지 1.50달러에 도달할 것으로 전망되어, 장기 보유 전략도 고려할 만한 것으로 보인다. 3. 네오 페페 ($NEOP), 암호화폐 시장의 탈중앙화를 선도 암호화폐가 주류로 자리잡으면서 정부와 같은 기관들이 이에 대한 통제력을 강화하려는 움직임을 보이고 있다. 이는 탈중앙화를 핵심 가치로 삼는 암호화폐의 본래 취지에 위배되는 상황이다. 이에 네오 페페($NEOP)는 시장에서 탈중앙화가 완전히 사라지기 전에 진정한 의미의 탈중앙화를 되살리고자 하는 목표를 가지고 있다. 네오 페페 토큰 보유자들은 프로젝트의 의사결정 과정에 참여할 수 있는 권한을 갖게 된다. 프로젝트에 새로운 아이디어를 제안하고, 재정 지출 방안에 대한 의견을 제시할 수 있으며, 토큰 상장 거래소 선정에도 참여할 수 있는 것으로 알려졌다. 해당 프로젝트는 프리세일 시작 후 단 10일 만에 140만 달러 이상의 투자금을 모집하며 투자자들의 이목을 빠르게 사로잡았다. 이는 암호화폐 시장에서 탈중앙화가 성공의 핵심 요소라는 사실을 다시 한번 입증하는 결과로 평가된다. 비트코인 15 만 달러 시대 전망 밝아 비트코인의 15만 달러 돌파가 이제 가능성의 문제가 아닌 시기의 문제로 전환됐다. 시장에 자금 유입이 지속될 경우 향후 수개월 내 해당 가격대 도달이 충분히 실현 가능할 것으로 전망된다. 비트코인 시장이 상승세를 보일 때마다 새로운 암호화폐 사전 판매가 호황을 누릴 것으로 전망된다. 이러한 상황에서 BTC 불 토큰($BTCBULL) 과 비트코인 하이퍼($HYPER) 등 비트코인 관련 프로젝트들이 이러한 기회를 활용할 수 있는 최적의 시기와 위치에 있는 것으로 평가된다. 암호화폐 시장의 상위 트렌드에 투자를 고려하는 투자자들은 사전 조사가 필수적인 것으로 알려졌다. 시장의 위험성과 기회 요인을 충분히 파악하고, 감당할 수 있는 범위 내에서 투자를 진행하는 것이 바람직한 것으로 전문가들은 조언하고 있다. 본 기사의 내용은 교육 목적으로만 활용되어야 하며, 투자 자문으로 간주되어선 안 된다는 점을 밝힌다.",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-150k-best-presales-kr-2/,Altcoin News
1750254601,2025-06-18 21:50:01,Nobitex Exploit: Massive $48.65M Attack Hits Iranian Crypto Exchange on TRON Network,"BitcoinWorld Nobitex Exploit: Massive $48.65M Attack Hits Iranian Crypto Exchange on TRON Network The world of cryptocurrency, while offering exciting opportunities, is unfortunately no stranger to security breaches. The latest incident shaking the market involves Nobitex, a prominent Iranian cryptocurrency exchange. Reports have surfaced detailing a significant Nobitex exploit on the TRON (TRX) Network, resulting in substantial financial losses. This event serves as a stark reminder of the persistent security challenges within the digital asset space. Understanding the Scope of the Nobitex Exploit According to on-chain detective ZachXBT, who shared details on Telegram, the Nobitex exploit led to estimated total losses of approximately $48.65 million. This figure represents a significant amount of value compromised from the exchange’s holdings or user funds held on the platform. Details emerging about the attack point to the use of a vanity address by the attacker. ZachXBT specifically noted the use of an address beginning with ‘TKFuck’, a tactic sometimes employed by malicious actors, potentially to taunt or simply for recognition. While the exact method of the exploit is still under investigation or not fully public, the outcome is clear: a large-scale compromise affecting a major regional exchange. The TRON Network Attack Context The incident specifically occurred on the TRON network attack . TRON is a popular blockchain platform known for its focus on decentralized applications and content sharing. While the exploit targeted Nobitex’s operations or wallets connected to the TRON network, it’s important to distinguish between an attack on the blockchain protocol itself and an attack on an entity operating on the network, like an exchange. In many exchange hacks, the vulnerability lies not within the underlying blockchain technology (like TRON, Bitcoin, or Ethereum) but rather in the exchange’s own systems, such as: Weaknesses in hot or cold wallet management Vulnerabilities in smart contracts used by the exchange Compromised private keys Insufficient security protocols or internal errors Phishing attacks targeting employees Further analysis will likely clarify if the vulnerability was specific to how Nobitex interacted with the TRON network or a more general security lapse within the exchange’s infrastructure that happened to impact TRON-based assets. Broader Implications of a Crypto Exchange Hack A crypto exchange hack like the one experienced by Nobitex has ripple effects far beyond the immediate financial loss. These incidents severely impact user trust, which is a critical component for any financial platform, especially in the nascent crypto industry. When an exchange is compromised, users worry about the safety of their own funds and may withdraw assets, potentially causing liquidity issues for the exchange. Other implications include: Reputational Damage: An exchange’s reputation can be severely tarnished, making it difficult to attract new users or retain existing ones. Regulatory Scrutiny: Security breaches often attract attention from financial regulators, potentially leading to investigations, fines, or stricter compliance requirements. Market Volatility: Large hacks can sometimes cause temporary dips in the prices of affected cryptocurrencies or the broader market due to panic selling or negative sentiment. Increased Security Costs: Exchanges are forced to invest heavily in improving their security infrastructure after an attack, which can be costly. For Nobitex, being the largest exchange in Iran, this event carries particular weight for the local crypto community and its confidence in digital asset platforms. Enhancing Cryptocurrency Security Measures In the wake of incidents like the Nobitex exploit , the focus inevitably shifts to enhancing cryptocurrency security . Both exchanges and individual users play a crucial role in mitigating risks. For exchanges, robust security practices are non-negotiable: Cold Storage: Keeping a vast majority of user funds in offline cold storage wallets, inaccessible from the internet. Multi-Signature Wallets: Requiring multiple private keys to authorize transactions, preventing a single point of failure. Regular Security Audits: Conducting frequent third-party audits of smart contracts, infrastructure, and internal processes. Intrusion Detection Systems: Implementing sophisticated systems to monitor for suspicious activity. Employee Training: Educating staff on phishing risks and secure operational procedures. For users, personal security is paramount: Enable 2FA: Always use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), preferably hardware-based, on your exchange accounts. Strong Passwords: Use unique, complex passwords and consider a password manager. Be Wary of Phishing: Verify the legitimacy of emails and websites before entering login details. Withdraw to Personal Wallets: For long-term storage, withdraw significant amounts of crypto from exchanges to hardware or software wallets where you control the private keys. Research Exchanges: Use reputable exchanges with a strong security track record. The Challenge of Digital Asset Loss and Recovery The estimated $48.65 million figure represents a significant digital asset loss . Recovering stolen cryptocurrency is incredibly challenging. While blockchain transactions are transparent and traceable, identifying and apprehending the individuals behind the wallet addresses used in exploits requires significant effort, often involving international cooperation between law enforcement and blockchain analytics firms. Trackers like ZachXBT play a vital role in following the flow of stolen funds across various networks and exchanges, making it harder for attackers to cash out undetected. However, once funds are laundered through mixers, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), or moved across multiple chains, they can become exceedingly difficult to trace back to an identifiable entity. For users affected by the Nobitex exploit, the path to recovery is uncertain. Exchanges sometimes use insurance funds or their own reserves to compensate users for losses, but this is not always guaranteed and depends heavily on the exchange’s policies and financial health. Conclusion: A Persistent Threat The Nobitex exploit on the TRON Network is another unfortunate chapter in the ongoing struggle for security in the cryptocurrency space. The estimated $48.65 million digital asset loss highlights the lucrative target that exchanges represent for malicious actors. This crypto exchange hack underscores the critical need for exchanges to continuously strengthen their cryptocurrency security measures and for users to adopt vigilant personal security practices. While the transparency of the TRON network allows for tracking, the recovery of funds after a large-scale TRON network attack targeting an exchange remains a complex challenge. As the industry matures, improving security infrastructure and user education will be paramount to building a safer ecosystem for everyone.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially started a formal process to decide whether to approve or reject the proposed Franklin XRP ETF . A final decision is expected by September 9, 2025 — a date to watch out for. XRP ETF Formal Process Began The proposal , filed by Cboe BZX Exchange , would allow Franklin Templeton to launch an ETF that holds physical XRP, similar to how Bitcoin ETFs now hold actual Bitcoin. The ETF plans to use Coinbase Custody Trust to store the tokens, while the price would track the CF Benchmark CME XRP-Dollar Index. It would be listed under Cboe’s BZX Exchange, following the same rules used for other commodity-based trusts. SEC Has Until 9 Sept To Revive XRP ETF But before that happens, the SEC wants to take a closer look. The agency has moved into the “Order Instituting Proceedings” phase, which is basically a formal investigation. The SEC is now gathering opinions and data to answer big questions: Will this XRP ETF protect investors? Can it prevent market manipulation? And does it meet the standards of the law? The review process started back in March 2025, and the next major date is September 9, 2025. By then, the SEC will likely reach a decision, either greenlighting the ETF or blocking it. Public Comments Are Open What’s interesting is that the SEC is now actively asking the public for comments. They’re especially interested in whether the XRP market is mature enough to handle an ETF without price manipulation or unfair trading practices. For now, all eyes are on September. If the SEC gives the green light, it could mark a huge milestone for XRP As of now, XRP price is trading around $2.12, reflecting a rise of 4.14% seen in the last 24 hours.",https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-etf-approval-decision-expected-by-september/,News
1750254061,2025-06-18 21:41:01,Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Consolidation Continues but Bearish Signs Flash,"After multiple failed attempts to break above the $108K resistance, Bitcoin is consolidating within a tightening range, showing signs of distribution. The market is caught between two liquidity zones: the buy-side above $108K and the sell-side beneath $100K, while the price slowly gravitates toward the lower boundary. Momentum has weakened as seen in the RSI drop below 50 on both daily and 4H timeframes, suggesting bearish pressure is gaining control. By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart Bitcoin remains stuck in a broader consolidation pattern, forming a descending triangle just below a major resistance level. The RSI is holding around 46, and the price is still above the key trendline depicted in orange. This structure reflects a classic re-accumulation or distribution phase. If the bulls fail to reclaim $108K with conviction, the ascending trendline becomes a likely magnet. Moreover, the orange 100-day MA and the blue 200-day MA are still pointing up but have narrowed near the $95K region, indicating a slowdown in trend strength. The daily range between $100K–$108K is critical. So far, buyers have absorbed dips into the $101K–$103K zone, but continued lower highs and failure to flip the $108K area into support suggest the market may be preparing for a deeper sweep of liquidity. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, the price action has formed a clear descending channel. The lower highs show consistent bearish pressure, while support at $103.5K is being tested repeatedly. This is often a bearish continuation pattern, and with RSI around 41, the momentum leans toward the downside. The failure to break through the fair value gap (FVG) around $106K, and even failing to test it, confirms that sellers are defending the premium levels efficiently. Currently, market participants can expect a quick sweep of the double sell-side liquidity levels marked around $102K and $103K. A break and close below these levels could open up a run toward the key daily demand at the $100K area. Meanwhile, any upside breakout above $110K must begin with a reclaim of the FVG zone convincingly to flip short-term sentiment. On-Chain Analysis Exchange Whale Ratio The whale ratio on exchanges has surged above 0.55, its highest point in over a year, which is typically considered a warning signal. This metric measures the proportion of the top 10 inflows to total inflows on exchanges. Historically, a rising whale ratio means large holders are increasingly active on exchanges, likely preparing to sell. This shift often precedes corrections or sharp volatility, especially when retail activity is cooling off. Combining this with stagnant price action below key resistance, the current whale behavior suggests cautious distribution rather than aggressive accumulation. If the whale ratio remains elevated while BTC trades sideways or drops further, it strengthens the case for a liquidity sweep below $100K before any potential continuation higher.

1750254059,2025-06-18 21:40:59,Urgent Shift: Bitcoin Mining Giants Expand US Production Amid China Tariffs,"BitcoinWorld Urgent Shift: Bitcoin Mining Giants Expand US Production Amid China Tariffs The global landscape of Bitcoin mining is undergoing a significant transformation, largely driven by geopolitical forces. For years, the production of the specialized computer hardware essential for mining, known as ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), has been dominated by a handful of companies based in China. However, the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China have created powerful incentives for these manufacturing giants to reconsider their strategies and geographical footprint. This strategic pivot is not just a business decision; it’s a structural shift impacting the entire crypto mining supply chain and raising important questions about national security and economic resilience. Understanding the Giants Driving US Manufacturing Expansion At the heart of this story are three titans of the mining hardware industry: Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT. These companies collectively hold an estimated over 90% share of the global market for Bitcoin mining rigs. Their dominance means that virtually every large-scale Bitcoin mining operation, regardless of its location, relies heavily on their products. For decades, their manufacturing base has been primarily in China, leveraging the country’s established electronics supply chain, infrastructure, and labor force. However, the imposition of tariffs under former President Donald Trump’s administration, specifically targeting goods imported from China, significantly increased the cost of these crucial components for US-based mining operations. These tariffs acted as a direct financial burden, making it more expensive to set up or expand mining facilities in the United States. This economic pressure point became a major catalyst for the Chinese manufacturers to explore alternatives to mitigate the impact and remain competitive in a key market. Why Are China Tariffs Pushing Mining Hardware Production to the US? The primary driver for Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT’s decision to ramp up US manufacturing is the direct financial penalty imposed by the tariffs. Importing ASICs manufactured in China into the United States incurs substantial additional costs, which are ultimately passed on to the customers – the US Bitcoin miners. By establishing production capabilities within the US, these companies can potentially bypass or significantly reduce these tariff-related expenses, making their products more cost-effective for American buyers. Beyond just tariffs, other factors are at play: Market Proximity: The United States has rapidly become one of the largest and most attractive regions for Bitcoin mining globally, thanks to factors like access to abundant, often cheap, energy sources (renewables, natural gas flares) and a favorable regulatory environment in certain states. Having production closer to this major customer base can improve logistics, reduce shipping times and costs, and allow for quicker response to market demand. Supply Chain Resilience: Relying on a single manufacturing hub, especially one in a potentially adversarial geopolitical environment, introduces significant supply chain risks. Diversifying production locations enhances resilience against future trade disputes, export restrictions, or other disruptions. National Security Concerns: As the article notes, the heavy reliance of US infrastructure (including crypto mining, which is seen by some as critical digital infrastructure) on hardware from a geopolitical rival has raised national security concerns. While the manufacturers’ move is primarily economic, it aligns with broader calls for diversifying critical supply chains away from China. Customer Relationships: Local production can facilitate stronger relationships with large institutional mining clients in the US, offering better support, repair services, and potentially customized solutions. Examining the Strategies: How Are the Giants Adapting? Each of the big three is implementing its own version of a localization strategy: Bitmain: As the market leader, Bitmain made an early move, reportedly beginning production in the U.S. in December 2023. This timing, shortly after the U.S. presidential election, suggests a proactive approach to navigate the political landscape and potential future trade policies. Bitmain has previously explored US operations, including mining farms, indicating a long-term interest in the North American market. Canaan: Canaan, another major player, initiated trial manufacturing in April. The timing here is also notable, following discussions around potential new or reinforced tariffs, sometimes referred to informally as ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs in political discourse. Trial manufacturing allows Canaan to test the feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and logistical challenges of US production before committing to a larger scale. MicroBT: The maker of the popular Whatsminer series is focusing on a broader “localization strategy.” This might involve not just manufacturing but also establishing stronger local sales, support, and repair networks. While the specific details of their US production plans might differ, the goal is the same: reduce exposure to trade restrictions and better serve the North American market. It’s important to note that “production” in the US might initially focus on assembly rather than the complex, capital-intensive fabrication of the ASIC chips themselves, which still heavily relies on advanced foundries primarily located in Asia (like TSMC in Taiwan). However, even assembly in the US represents a significant step towards shifting part of the value chain geographically. What Does This Mean for the US Crypto Mining Landscape? The expansion of mining hardware production within the United States has several potential implications for the domestic crypto mining industry: Reduced Costs (Potentially): By avoiding tariffs, the cost of acquiring new mining rigs could decrease for US operators, improving profitability and encouraging further investment in domestic mining infrastructure. Faster Deployment: Shorter supply chains mean quicker delivery times for new equipment, allowing miners to scale their operations more rapidly in response to market conditions. Enhanced Supply Chain Security: Domestic production offers greater predictability and security of supply compared to relying solely on imports subject to geopolitical risks. Job Creation: Establishing and operating manufacturing or assembly plants creates jobs in the US, contributing to the local economy in states that attract these facilities. Development of Domestic Expertise: Increased manufacturing activity can foster the development of a skilled workforce and technical expertise related to ASIC production and maintenance within the US. While the benefits are clear, challenges remain. The cost of labor and manufacturing in the US is generally higher than in China. Sourcing components, many of which are still produced in Asia, could also present logistical hurdles. However, the strategic advantages, particularly tariff avoidance and supply chain security, appear to outweigh these challenges for the major players. Beyond Tariffs: The Long-Term Impact on the Global Mining Supply Chain The shift of Chinese mining hardware manufacturers towards US production is more than a temporary response to trade policy; it signals a potential long-term restructuring of the global Bitcoin mining supply chain. For years, the supply chain has been heavily centralized in East Asia, from chip design and fabrication to assembly and distribution. This move suggests a trend towards decentralization and regionalization. As more production capacity is established outside of China, other regions like North America could develop more robust local ecosystems for mining hardware – including repair centers, component suppliers, and potentially even domestic design and fabrication capabilities in the future. This could lead to a more diversified and resilient global mining network, less susceptible to disruptions in any single country. Furthermore, this trend could encourage the emergence or growth of non-Chinese mining hardware manufacturers, fostering greater competition in a market currently dominated by the big three. While challenging, the opportunity exists for companies in the US or other geopolitically neutral countries to capture market share by offering domestically produced or assembled hardware. Addressing National Security and Supply Chain Concerns The concerns around national security stem from the potential for hardware backdoors or vulnerabilities embedded during the manufacturing process, as well as the strategic risk of relying on a competitor for essential digital infrastructure components. While these concerns are complex and often debated, a shift towards domestic or allied-country production of Bitcoin mining equipment can, in theory, alleviate some of these worries by bringing parts of the supply chain under the jurisdiction and oversight of the host country. Increased US manufacturing of mining hardware contributes to greater supply chain transparency and potentially allows for more stringent security checks and quality control processes that align with US standards and regulations. This is particularly relevant as Bitcoin mining becomes increasingly integrated into the energy sector and attracts larger institutional players. What’s Next? The Future of Mining Hardware Production The success and scale of these initial US production efforts will likely determine the extent of future expansion. Factors to watch include: The evolution of US trade policy towards China. The cost-effectiveness of US manufacturing compared to traditional hubs. The ability to build a skilled workforce and reliable local component supply chains in the US. Demand from US-based mining operations. If these initiatives prove successful, we could see a more permanent shift, with a significant portion of global mining hardware assembly serving the North American market being done locally. This would not only reshape the business models of the major manufacturers but also further solidify North America’s position as a major global hub for crypto mining activity. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Bitcoin Mining The decision by Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT to expand production in the United States marks a pivotal moment for the Bitcoin mining industry. Driven primarily by the economic pressures of China tariffs , this move is accelerating a broader trend towards the regionalization and diversification of the global mining hardware supply chain. While challenges in manufacturing costs and component sourcing remain, the strategic benefits of being closer to a major market like the US, avoiding tariffs, and enhancing supply chain security are compelling. This shift is not just about where machines are made; it’s about building a more resilient, geographically diverse, and potentially more secure foundation for the future of Bitcoin mining worldwide. As the US continues to grow as a mining destination, domestic hardware production could become an increasingly vital component of its digital infrastructure.

Built on the Base blockchain after migrating from Polygon for lower gas costs and faster transactions, Favrr introduces a novel financial infrastructure for fandoms — combining gamified finance, real-world prediction markets, and community-driven economics. The platform introduces an innovative launch model known as the Initial Fan Offering (IFO), designed to protect early supporters. During an IFO, only buy transactions are allowed, preventing any premature sell-offs. If a fan asset doesn’t meet its demand threshold, investors are fully refunded — ensuring a safe and fair experience for participants. This sets Favrr apart from typical meme coin launches and “pump and dump” schemes, providing a more sustainable token economy. Favrr’s upcoming IDO on Coin Terminal aims to build on the platform’s early momentum and will mark the official public release of the $FAVRR token. Coin Terminal has previously hosted several high-impact Web3 token launches, and Favrr’s debut is expected to attract both crypto enthusiasts and retail investors interested in the intersection of culture and decentralized finance. The recent $5 million investment from Von Rosen was made entirely in equity and reflects strong institutional confidence in Favrr’s long-term potential. Von Rosen’s portfolio includes other breakout ventures in Web3 infrastructure, DeFi protocols, and entertainment tech, positioning Favrr alongside some of the space’s most promising projects. The capital will support Favrr’s roadmap, including further development of its gamified market engine, expansion of fandom partnerships, and enhanced user onboarding tools. Favrr’s leadership also includes Chairman Dr.David Frederik von Rosen-von Hoewel, founder of the VONROSEN family office and a serial entrepreneur behind multiple global ventures. Dr. Von Rosen is listed on the World Economic Forum for his leadership and impact across sectors, including gaming, web3, and mobility, adding further institutional credibility and strategic vision to FAVRR’s trajectory. Favrr offers a variety of interactive features that blend cultural participation with financial literacy. Its Boardroom Market Challenge invites users to stake FAVEs and make informed predictions on real-world events, mirroring shareholder decision-making. In doing so, Favrr becomes more than a trading platform; it’s a learning environment where users build market skills and community conviction. Unlike traditional NFTs that rely on speculation, FAVEs are ERC-1155 multi-asset tokens designed with real utility, from prediction games and community governance to potential access-based rewards. A portion of Favrr’s platform fees also goes to charitable causes, with token holders voting on fund distribution, reinforcing a social impact ethos rarely seen in similar platforms. As anticipation builds for the $FAVRR IDO, the team continues to prioritize sustainable growth and user safety. The pre-TGE airdrop campaign is currently live, rewarding early platform participants and community builders. Final token allocations are subject to adjustments based on market conditions at launch to ensure fair and strategic distribution. With its IFO-driven approach and buy-only bonding curve mechanics, the project anticipates negligible sell pressure upon TGE, supporting a healthier post-launch token economy. Favrr invites fans, creators, DAOs, and cultural entrepreneurs to “cash in on their fandom” by turning passion into portfolio. The platform is open-access and permissionless — allowing anyone, from Taylor Swift enthusiasts to space exploration advocates, to launch FAVEs and grow vibrant, community-backed economies. With a strong user base, validated investor backing, and a transparent launch framework, Favrr is poised to become a cornerstone of the emerging fandom economy. About Favrr Favrr is an all-in-one web3 platform that combines a token launcher, a prediction market, and an intelligent investor discovery engine, built for communities to turn their passion into financial opportunities. With over 33,000 active users and growing daily, Favrr empowers anyone to create or join token-backed cultural economies and earn by expressing real conviction. Backed by a $5 million all-equity investment from the VonRosen family office, Favrr enables smarter investment through gamified participation, strategic staking, and community-driven value. Built on Base and designed for long-term sustainability, Favrr transforms fan culture into tradable digital assets with purpose.

1750253669,2025-06-18 21:34:29,War Headlines Hit Bitcoin—But Dip Buyers Eye New Highs,"Bitcoin price action has been a roller coaster this week, as escalating Middle East tensions and dramatic Washington headlines have triggered sharp intraday swoons—only to be met by stubborn dip-buying that's kept BTC within striking distance of its all-time highs. As Israel and Iran exchange missile strikes and former President Trump takes emergency security meetings, risk appetite worldwide has faltered, but Bitcoin's underlying bullish momentum is undeniable. Geopolitical Shockwaves and Trump's Security Meetings The latest bout of volatility began after reports that Israel had launched its largest attack on Iran in decades, sparking fear of wider regional conflict. It took a turn for the worse after Trump abruptly pulled out of the G7 summit and called for an emergency Situation Room meeting, urging Americans to depart Tehran. The market's reaction was immediate: Bitcoin lost over $2,000 in a matter of hours, and altcoins plummeted even harder, wiping out $80 billion in cryptocurrency market capitalization. Traders were hit with nearly $400 million in liquidations, with leveraged longs being blindsided. Yet, as the dust settled, Bitcoin's price stabilized above $103,000. This kind of resilience is similar to previous wartime shocks, where BTC sold off in the first instance but soon got back on its feet as markets adjusted to the new reality. In fact, historical data shows that after similar events—like the Israel-Gaza war in 2023 and the Iran embassy bombing in 2024—Bitcoin can bounce back within weeks, sometimes even outperforming traditional safe havens like gold. Funding Rates and ETF Inflows Continue to Be Bullish The special thing about this cycle is the speed and size of the bounce. On-chain metrics and derivatives markets show that, even as headlines spooked retail investors, institutional players and seasoned traders viewed the dip as a buying opportunity. Bitcoin perpetual futures funding rates, which temporarily turned negative during panic, have flipped positive again—meaning traders are paying a premium to hold long positions and are expecting higher prices in the future. ETF flows tell the same story. Despite the price decline, U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs gathered over $200 million of net inflows, led by BlackRock's IBIT with $639 million in a single day. Although inflows slowed from last week's record pace, the nine-week streak of positive flows has pushed year-to-date ETF inflows to $13.2 billion. That suggests that institutional investors remain confident in Bitcoin's long-term trajectory, even as short-term volatility shakes out less determined participants. Macro Context: How Bitcoin Behaves In Wartime Bitcoin's relationship with geopolitical risk is evolving. Historically, BTC has been considered a ”digital gold” hedge, but recent cycles have seen it behave more like a risk asset—selling off in conjunction with equities in crises, prior to rebounding as markets stabilize. Bitwise and CoinShares researchers note that Bitcoin's volatility has reduced structurally over time but remains vulnerable to global shocks. But the evidence shows that Bitcoin's post-war recoveries can be quick and decisive. After the COVID crash in 2020, BTC lost half its value within days, only to gain 583% over the next year. In the Russia-Ukraine war during 2022, Bitcoin dropped 20% before gaining 65% over two months. In spite of recent Israel-Iran tensions, BTC's ability to hold key support levels and attract new inflows is a sign of a market that's ageing—and increasingly being driven by institutional money. The Bottom Line Despite war-driven volatility and headline risk, the underlying Bitcoin narrative remains unchanged. Dip-buyers, positive funding rates, and relentless ETF inflows suggest the market's conviction is stronger than fear. If history is any guide, Bitcoin's strength amidst geopolitical shock can yet again set the stage for fresh highs—especially with institutions still buying and traders betting on a V-shaped recovery.",https://coinpaper.com/9614/war-headlines-hit-bitcoin-but-dip-buyers-eye-new-highs,News|Bitcoin

The firm has appointed Kathleen Wrynn, a seasoned JP Morgan executive, to lead its $1.6 billion cryptocurrency division. The hire comes at a time when institutional interest in digital assets is gaining strong momentum. Invesco’s decision reflects a clear intention to be a major player in the future of crypto investing. Crypto’s New Leader: Wrynn Assumes Command As traditional finance continues warming up to crypto, Invesco’s move to bring in Wrynn is more than a leadership shuffle. It signals a strategic push to stay ahead. Wrynn brings a strong track record from her years at JP Morgan. She now leads Invesco’s digital asset strategy, which includes managing three Blockchain and Crypto Ecosystem ETFs, along with three Global Spot Cryptocurrency ETFs. At the Morgan Stanley U.S. Financials Conference, an Invesco spokesperson detailed her mission: “She will work closely with the global technology organization to identify and lead opportunities to leverage blockchain technology, such as tokenizing funds and integrating digital assets into investment strategies.” This appointment shows Invesco’s commitment to innovation in the crypto space. Institutional Crypto Rise: Invesco Joins the Trend Invesco’s action corresponds with a Coinbase report indicating that 86% of institutional investors are either involved in or intend to enter crypto by 2025. This encouraging indication in adoption implies Wall Street’s complete acceptance of digital assets, making way for quicker Bitcoin expansion and limited supply. Invesco’s $1.6 billion cryptocurrency operation enables it to take advantage of this trend, cementing its position as a frontrunner in the changing financial environment. Wrynn’s guidance might be crucial in steering through this new age. Invesco Bets Big on Crypto’s Future As institutional interest in crypto grows, Invesco’s strategic hire of Wrynn indicates confidence in Bitcoin’s future.

1750253528,2025-06-18 21:32:08,Meta Pool Faces Exploit But Hacker Escapes With Only $132K,"An exploit on the Ethereum-based staking protocol Meta Pool on Tuesday could have resulted in a $27 million heist, but the attacker walked away with only $132,000 worth of Ether (ETH), thanks to low liquidity and swift action by the protocol’s team. According to a blog post by Meta Pool, the attacker exploited the “fast unstake functionality” to mint 9,705 mpETH tokens — the platform’s liquid staking token — valued at nearly $27 million. However, due to limited liquidity in the swap pools and Meta Pool’s prompt contract pause, the hacker managed to convert only a fraction of the minted tokens into 52.5 ETH, worth just over $132,000. Meta Pool’s early detection systems flagged the suspicious activity, allowing the team to freeze the exploited smart contract and prevent further loss. Co-founder Claudio Cossio stated on X that the fast unstaking feature, which skips the standard waiting period after unstaking, was key to the exploit. This mechanism can offer users faster access to funds but can pose security risks if not carefully implemented. Bug in Mint Function Blockchain security firm PeckShield confirmed that the vulnerability stemmed from a critical bug in the staking contract’s ERC4626 mint() function. This flaw enabled the attacker to mint mpETH tokens without any cost. However, because mpETH is a relatively illiquid token, the hacker’s ability to convert the tokens into ETH was significantly hindered. The attacker primarily targeted liquidity pools on Ethereum mainnet and Optimism, draining 52.5 ETH in total. One of the affected pools on Optimism had particularly low volume and liquidity, which helped contain the damage. In its statement, Meta Pool reassured users that all staked Ethereum remains secure, as it is delegated through the SSV Network and continues to accrue staking rewards. The team has paused the affected mpETH contract and plans to publish a full post-mortem within the next 48 hours, along with a recovery plan. Exploit Cases Rise Across Crypto Platforms Meta Pool joins a growing list of DeFi platforms exploit cases this month. On June 6, Bitcoin-based DeFi platform Alex Protocol lost $8.3 million due to a self-listing flaw, while Taiwan-based exchange BitoPro reported a $11.5 million hot wallet breach from May 8. Despite the failed theft attempt, the Meta Pool incident underscores the growing need for rigorous security auditing in DeFi platforms , especially as protocols race to offer faster user functionality without compromising safety.

1750253510,2025-06-18 21:31:50,Angry Pepe Fork vs. SpacePay vs. SUBBD: which crypto presale will explode first?,"Presale cryptocurrency tokens are expected to make big ripples in 2025. From joke currencies to payment platforms, investors are looking for the best cryptocurrency presale to purchase right now. When supported by actual features and engaged communities, early-stage ventures have a lot of potential. Today’s top cryptocurrency presales are Angry Pepe Fork , SpacePay, and SUBBD. Each adds something unique—real-world integration, viral usefulness, or specialized payment mechanisms. Let’s see how these cryptocurrencies on presale stand up. SUBBD converts subscriptions into one token system SUBBD seeks to change the way consumers pay for subscriptions. The idea is simple: merge Netflix, Spotify, and other services under a single token payment mechanism. Instead of managing various bills, consumers may pay everything with SUBBD. The concept has potential; however, the initiative is still in its early stages. There is no functional platform yet, and progress has been sluggish. The community is tiny, and investor trust is low. It’s one of the most unusual crypto ICO presale concepts, but it still has to establish its usefulness. SpacePay bridges crypto and card payments SpacePay is attempting to make cryptocurrency payments as easy as swiping a conventional card. It is building an APK that will interact with card machines, allowing shops to accept cryptocurrency from over 300 wallets. This might make cryptocurrencies more useful in ordinary transactions. The objective is not to replace fiat currency, but rather to make cryptocurrency more usable in everyday situations. That kind of accessibility might help SpacePay develop quickly. As far as crypto presale initiatives go, SpacePay prioritizes functionality above excitement, which has earned it early backers. Angry Pepe Fork delivers real rewards and real fun Angry Pepe Fork ($APORK) is more than just a meme; it’s an entire ecosystem that rewards its participants. It was priced at $0.0269 in presale and has already raised more than $240,000. That early success is supported by legitimate features such as staking, CommunityFi, and GambleFi mini-games. Presale customers may stake their Ethereum purchases to earn more than 10,000% APY. The earlier you check in, the higher your rate. CommunityFi allows users to earn $APORK by tweeting, uploading memes, or recommending others. It rewards every activity that helps the project flourish. Then there’s GambleFi, a play-to-earn mechanism incorporated right within the token platform. You may use tokens in mini-games to earn extra $APORK. Following each win, a fraction of the tokens are burnt, which contributes to the long-term price increase. Angry Pepe Fork is more accessible than other presale token initiatives since it supports many blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Solana. With deflationary dynamics, community power, and early staking benefits, it is one of the best crypto presales for 2025. Final thoughts: Angry Pepe Fork leads presale crypto list SUBBD and SpacePay each have a unique concept, but Angry Pepe Fork provides greater value to today’s presale cryptocurrency purchasers. From staking incentives to viral engagement and deflationary tokenomics, it ticks all the boxes. As new crypto token presales emerge, Angry Pepe Fork gains traction. Earning, community, and clever mechanics are more than simply buzz. That is why it is the best cryptocurrency presale to invest in right now.

1750253470,2025-06-18 21:31:10,Ethereum staking stats hit all-time high levels with over 35M ETH locked,"CryptoQuant’s data revealed that more than 500K ETH was staked in the first half of June, pushing the total locked amount to a new all-time high of over 35M ETH. Holders with no history of selling (accumulation addresses) also reached an all-time high of 22.8M ETH. According to CryptoQuant, these two metrics combined positioned Ethereum as one of the strongest crypto assets in terms of long-term fundamentals and investor conviction. Data from Dune analytics also confirmed there were nearly 1.1M validators, with netflows of 13.9M ETH (16.9M ETH excluding rewards) since Shanghai. The data also confirmed that about 28.33% of all ETH in circulation was staked, and Ethereum’s economic security, the total dollar value of staked ETH, exceeded $91 billion. Lido tops staking provider list as seven ETH stakers hold 1M+ ETH Ethereum stakers according to amount staked. Source: Dune Dune’s data revealed Lido was the largest staking provider, holding 9.02 million ETH through 282K validators. The data also showed that the amount of staked ETH declined by 0.65% over the past month, accounting for 25.6% (-0.65%) of the total market share. The amount of staked ETH on Lido dropped by 1% (92.83K ETH) over the past 30 days and by 8% over the past six months, with a total of 833K ETH earned. Binance followed with a market share of 7.5% (2.65M ETH) of the staked ETH supply being held through 83K validators. The amount of staked ETH increased by 6% in the past month and 37% over the past six months, with 202K ETH earned. Coinbase was third with a market share of roughly 7.4% (2.59M ETH) held through 81K validators. Overall, the market share dropped by 0.26%, decreased by 2.0% over the past month, and decreased by 27% over six months. Slightly more than 400K was earned. Dune’s data also confirmed that ether.fi (2.3M ETH), Kiln (1.5M ETH), Kraken (~1.2M ETH), and Figment (1.03M ETH) completed the list of the top seven exchanges with over a million staked ETH. They had market shares of 6.6%, 4.3%, 3.4%, and 3.0%, respectively. The four exchanges earned a combined total of 359K ETH. “Although liquid staking solutions suggest conviction is growing for Ethereum…People are maybe expecting the price to go up in the future, and therefore feeling more confident in terms of holding the asset.” – Carlos Guzman , a Research Analyst at GSR Breaking down staked ETH by category, the data showed that 10.2M ETH (29.2%) was staked through liquid staking, 8.7M ETH (24.8%) through CEXs, and 6.4M ETH (18.3%) through staking pools. Additionally, 2.7M ETH (7.8%) was staked through liquid restaking, while 6.8M ETH (19.6%) was staked through unidentified means. Coinbase becomes Ethereum’s largest node operator Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, said that Coinbase’s stake made the exchange the “single largest node operator” in the network. CryptoQuant’s data confirmed that Coinbase was Ethereum’s largest node operator, holding over 11.4% of staked ETH supply through its validators. Sassano pointed out that while the staking platform Lido was bigger collectively, each node operator had a much smaller percentage share. Coinbase also reported that its validators had an average uptime of 99.75%, outperforming their target of 99% uptime without compromising security standards. The exchange attributed the performance to an upgrade implemented in 2024, which allowed the exchange to keep validators running while performing beacon node maintenance. Coinbase validators’ participation rate was also at 99.75%, exceeding the network average of 99.52%. The Coinbase team said the company distributed its validators across several regions to help maintain a “truly distributed” and decentralized Ethereum blockchain. The team added that Coinbase’s validators operate in Japan, Singapore, Ireland, Germany, and Hong Kong. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

1750253447,2025-06-18 21:30:47,XRP ETF Canada: Evolve Funds Poised for Historic Launch on Toronto Stock Exchange,"BitcoinWorld XRP ETF Canada: Evolve Funds Poised for Historic Launch on Toronto Stock Exchange Get ready, Canadian crypto enthusiasts! A potentially significant development is on the horizon for accessing digital assets through traditional investment vehicles. Canada’s Evolve Funds Group has announced its intention to launch the Evolve XRP ETF , bringing the popular cryptocurrency Ripple XRP into the regulated exchange-traded fund space on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). This move could mark a new chapter for investors looking to gain exposure to Ripple XRP without directly holding the digital asset. What is the Evolve XRP ETF and Why Does it Matter? The Evolve XRP ETF is designed to provide investors with exposure to the daily price movements of XRP, the digital asset associated with the Ripple payment network. Unlike buying and storing XRP yourself on a crypto exchange, an ETF trades on a traditional stock exchange like the Toronto Stock Exchange , making it accessible through standard brokerage accounts. This proposed XRP ETF Canada offering is significant for several reasons: Accessibility: It simplifies the investment process for traditional investors who are comfortable with brokerage platforms but might find navigating crypto exchanges and wallets daunting. Regulation: Trading on a regulated exchange like the TSX brings a level of oversight and investor protection not always present in direct crypto markets. Institutional Interest: The availability of an ETF can attract institutional investors who have mandates preventing direct crypto holdings but can invest in regulated fund products. Market Validation: The launch of a dedicated Canada Crypto ETF for XRP, following similar products for Bitcoin and Ethereum, signals growing acceptance and maturity of the digital asset class within Canadian financial markets. The ETF is expected to trade under the ticker symbols XRP (for the Canadian Dollar unhedged units) and XRP.U (for the US Dollar units), pending final approval from the TSX. How Does the Evolve XRP ETF Fit into the Canada Crypto ETF Landscape? Canada has been a leader in approving cryptocurrency ETFs, starting with Bitcoin and Ethereum products. Evolve Funds itself was among the first to launch a Bitcoin ETF (EBIT) and an Ethereum ETF (ETHR) on the TSX. The potential arrival of the Evolve XRP ETF further diversifies the options available to Canadian investors seeking regulated exposure to digital assets. Here’s a quick look at the evolving landscape: Asset Existing ETFs in Canada Evolve’s Offering Bitcoin (BTC) Multiple (e.g., Purpose, Evolve, CI Galaxy) Evolve Bitcoin ETF (EBIT) Ethereum (ETH) Multiple (e.g., Purpose, Evolve, CI Galaxy) Evolve Ether ETF (ETHR) XRP (Ripple) None (as of announcement) Proposed Evolve XRP ETF This expansion suggests growing investor demand and regulatory comfort with offering exposure to a wider range of prominent cryptocurrencies through the traditional financial system. The XRP ETF Canada would be a notable addition, offering access to an asset with a different use case (cross-border payments) compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum. Considering the Evolve XRP ETF: Benefits and Potential Drawbacks Like any investment, the proposed Evolve XRP ETF comes with its own set of potential upsides and considerations. Understanding these is crucial before making any investment decisions. Potential Benefits: Ease of Investment: As mentioned, buying shares of an ETF through a brokerage account is often simpler than managing private keys or dealing with different crypto exchange interfaces. Liquidity: ETFs trade throughout the day on the Toronto Stock Exchange , offering liquidity that can sometimes be challenging on smaller crypto exchanges. No Custody Worries: Investors don’t need to worry about securely storing XRP themselves; the fund handles the custody of the underlying asset. Diversification Potential: For investors building a diversified portfolio, an XRP ETF Canada could offer exposure to the digital asset sector through a regulated product. Potential Drawbacks: Fees: ETFs charge management fees, which can eat into returns over time compared to holding the asset directly (though direct holding has its own costs like exchange fees). Tracking Error: While designed to track the price of XRP, ETFs can sometimes experience minor tracking differences due to operational costs and market dynamics. Regulatory Uncertainty for XRP: While the ETF is regulated in Canada, the underlying asset, Ripple XRP , has faced significant regulatory challenges in other jurisdictions (most notably the ongoing SEC lawsuit in the United States), which can impact its price volatility and future prospects. Market Volatility: The price of XRP, like other cryptocurrencies, is highly volatile. Investing in the ETF means accepting this inherent market risk. Investors should weigh these factors carefully and consider their own risk tolerance and investment goals. What’s Next? The Path to Launch for the Evolve XRP ETF According to reports, the Evolve XRP ETF is currently awaiting final approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange . This is a standard step in the process for listing new financial products. Once approved, the ETF will become available for trading on the TSX under the specified ticker symbols. The exact launch date will depend on the timing of this final regulatory clearance. The launch of this Canada Crypto ETF for XRP could potentially: Increase mainstream investor exposure to Ripple XRP. Potentially impact the liquidity and trading volume of XRP. Further solidify Canada’s position as a leading jurisdiction for regulated crypto investment products. Market participants will be watching closely to see how the ETF is received by investors and what impact it has on the broader crypto market, particularly for Ripple XRP . Actionable Insights for Investors If you are considering investing in the proposed Evolve XRP ETF , here are a few steps you might consider: Stay Informed: Keep an eye out for the official approval announcement from Evolve Funds and the TSX. Understand XRP: Before investing in the ETF, take the time to understand what Ripple XRP is, its technology, use cases, and the regulatory environment surrounding it. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency markets are volatile. Ensure your investment aligns with your personal risk profile. Consult a Financial Advisor: Consider speaking with a qualified financial advisor to understand how this ETF might fit into your overall investment strategy. Summary: A New Era for XRP Access in Canada? The announcement by Evolve Funds Group regarding the planned launch of the Evolve XRP ETF on the Toronto Stock Exchange is a significant development for the Canadian crypto investment landscape. It represents the potential introduction of the first regulated ETF product offering exposure to Ripple XRP in the country. This move underscores the growing acceptance of digital assets within traditional finance and provides Canadian investors with another avenue to participate in the crypto market through a familiar and regulated structure. While awaiting final approval, the prospect of the XRP ETF Canada is certainly creating buzz among investors interested in expanding their digital asset portfolios.

1750253438,2025-06-18 21:30:38,"Researchers Forecast Bitcoin At $4.3 Million By 2036, Citing Institutional Demand","In a striking forecast, two academic researchers, Murray Rudd and Dennis Porter, have predicted that Bitcoin (BTC) could soar to an astonishing $4.3 million by 2036 if institutional buying trends continue. This prediction was highlighted by market expert Giovanni Incasa, who emphasized the significance of applying rigorous supply-demand theories to Bitcoin’s unique economic structure. Supply Shock Warning Rudd and Porter have employed pure mathematical modeling to analyze Bitcoin’s market dynamics, warning that the impending supply shock could lead to price fluctuations ten times more severe than anything seen to date. Their findings suggest that the effects of this supply shock will result in permanent wealth redistribution, fundamentally altering the landscape of digital assets. Related Reading: On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge According to their conservative estimates, the Bitcoin price could reach $2.2 million per coin by 2036, a projection rooted in what they describe as “economic physics.” The researchers note that the current liquid supply of Bitcoin stands at only 11.2 million coins, with an estimated 4 million Bitcoin lost forever due to lost keys and Satoshi Nakamoto’s unspent stash. Their analysis reveals that only half of BTC’s total supply is actively liquid, meaning that even modest institutional purchases could lead to significant supply shortages. Evidence of this trend can be seen in the daily buying habits of US exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have averaged 285 Bitcoin per day since their launch, and the actions of Bitcoin treasury companies that are removing thousands of coins from circulation through debt financing. Senator Cynthia Lummis has also proposed a strategic reserve of one million Bitcoin, which would involve an acquisition of approximately 550 coins per day over five years. The researchers calculate that if 2,000 Bitcoin are removed from circulation daily, the price could reach $106,000—a figure that is already close to today’s trading price of $104,800, suggesting that their mathematical framework is holding true. The crux of the researchers’ findings is that traditional supply curves are not applicable to BTC. Its perfectly inelastic supply creates significant bottlenecks as demand rises, leading to dramatic price increases. They emphasize that institutions that delay their investments risk becoming permanently priced out of the market. Three Scenarios For Bitcoin Rudd and Porter outline three potential scenarios for Bitcoin’s future. In a conservative scenario, with a 20-fold increase in demand and continued institutional adoption leading to 2,000 daily Bitcoin withdrawals, prices could reach $2.2 million by 2036. Their bullish scenario posits a 30-fold demand growth, where Bitcoin could hit $5 million by early 2031. The most extreme, hyperbolic scenario anticipates a 40-fold demand increase, with daily withdrawals escalating to 4,000 Bitcoin, potentially driving prices to $4.3 million by 2036 and valuing Bitcoin at six times the current market cap of gold.

1750253436,2025-06-18 21:30:36,XRP Beginner’s Guide — What You Need to Know,"If you’re new to crypto or finally taking a closer look at XRP, this guide provides everything you need to understand one of the most practical and widely used digital assets in the space. In a clear and insightful thread on X, well-known crypto analyst Pumpius broke down XRP’s core features and real-world applications, cutting through the noise to focus on facts. Building on that foundation, this guide explores what XRP is, how it works, and why it matters today. What Is XRP? XRP is a digital asset built for real-time, cross-border payments. While Bitcoin was created to function as a decentralized store of value, XRP was specifically designed to make global money transfers faster, cheaper, and more scalable. According to Pumpius, XRP processes transactions in just three to five seconds, costs less than a cent per transaction, and can handle over 1,500 transactions per second. This speed and efficiency are what separate XRP from most other cryptocurrencies. It isn’t meant to replace traditional money, but rather to upgrade how money moves. As Pumpius puts it, “It’s not ‘just another coin. ’ It’s infrastructure.” Beginner’s Guide to $XRP — What You Need to Know If you’re just getting into crypto or finally curious about XRP, this thread breaks down what it is, how it works, and why it matters. No hype. No noise. Just facts. pic.twitter.com/fIqSz4U106 — Pumpius (@pumpius) June 17, 2025 Understanding the XRP Ledger (XRPL) The technology behind XRP is the XRP Ledger , commonly referred to as XRPL. This is the decentralized blockchain network where XRP transactions take place. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which depend on energy-heavy mining, XRPL uses a consensus mechanism that doesn’t require mining at all. This makes it environmentally friendly, incredibly fast, and highly reliable, with the ledger closing every few seconds. Pumpius explains it best: “Think of XRPL as the highway. XRP is the car.” The ledger also comes with advanced capabilities, including a built-in decentralized exchange (DEX), native tokenization, and support for real-world assets like stablecoins, NFTs, and even tokenized biotech data. This makes the XRPL not just a payments network but a powerful platform for developers and institutions building on-chain solutions. Who Uses XRP and the XRPL? XRP’s real-world use extends well beyond trading. Ripple, the fintech company closely associated with XRP, uses it to develop global payment solutions for financial institutions. Through RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity, XRP helps banks and remittance companies settle international payments within seconds, removing the need for pre-funded accounts and reducing costs. Pumpius highlights that XRP and XRPL aren’t just used by banks. Developers are building a wide range of projects on the ledger, including DeFi protocols, tokenized asset platforms, and even biotech applications such as XRP Healthcare and DNA Protocol. These projects demonstrate that XRP is not just about finance; it’s about enabling secure and efficient value transfer across multiple industries.

Bitcoin is widely viewed as a store of value, often referred to as digital gold . Ethereum dominates the smart contract space but faces persistent issues with network congestion and high fees . XRP, in contrast, is optimized for real-time value transfers and liquidity provisioning. Pumpius summarizes it this way: “XRP isn’t trying to replace banks—it’s replacing their plumbing.” Instead of tearing down the financial system, XRP enhances the infrastructure behind it. Legal Status and Regulatory Clarity One of the most significant milestones in XRP’s journey came in 2023, when U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security when sold on digital asset exchanges. This decision gave XRP a rare level of regulatory clarity in the United States—something that most cryptocurrencies still lack. Pumpius rightly called it “one of the most important wins in crypto history.” The ruling allowed XRP to be relisted on major U.S. exchanges and restored institutional confidence in the asset. How to Store XRP Safely Pumpius stresses the importance of self-custody for those holding XRP. Rather than leaving assets on exchanges, where users don’t control their private keys, he advises using secure wallets such as Xaman, Tangem, or Ledger hardware wallets. As he puts it, “Not your keys = not your coins.” In crypto, maintaining control of your assets is essential. Final Thoughts XRP is not built on hype. As Pumpius concluded, “XRP is not hype. It’s not a meme. It’s one of the most adopted, fastest, and legally clarified assets in crypto.” With a clear use case, powerful infrastructure, and growing adoption across sectors, XRP stands out as a practical tool in the future of finance and decentralized value transfer. For beginners seeking a serious and credible introduction to digital assets, XRP is a smart place to start. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

PEPE is showing a bullish chart pattern, and Dogecoin looks set for a major breakout. The market is filled with anticipation. In the midst of this, XYZVerse has surfaced as a potential key player. Can this emerging asset take advantage of the upward trend and secure its place in the rally? Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE , Dogwifhat , and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 – $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if the project secures major partner ships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Pepe (PEPE) Source: TradingView Pepe (PEPE) has seen notable price fluctuations recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by 16.33%, and over the past month, it dropped by 12.98%. Looking back six months, the coin has declined by 45.52%. Currently, PEPE is trading within the range of $0.000009852 to $0.00001299, showing a period of consolidation after significant volatility. Technical indicators suggest varying signals for PEPE. The 10-day simple moving average is at $0.00001063, slightly below the 100-day average of $0.00001103. This narrowing gap may indicate a potential shift in trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 32.25, approaching the oversold territory, which could hint at a possible rebound. Additionally, the Stochastic indicator is at 27.33, also suggesting the coin might be oversold. PEPE faces immediate resistance at $0.00001486. Breaking through this level could pave the way toward the second resistance at $0.00001800, representing a potential increase of over 40% from current levels. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.000008588. If the price falls below this, it might test the second support at $0.000005449, a decrease of around 45%. Traders are watching these levels closely as they may signal significant price movements ahead. Dogecoin (DOGE) Source: TradingView Dogecoin has seen significant fluctuations recently. Over the past week, its price dropped by 10.31%. In the last month, it decreased by 18.97%. Looking back over six months, the decline is 51.44%. The current price ranges between $0.1615 and $0.1976. This shows a consistent downward trend in the short and medium term. Despite the recent declines, Dogecoin may find support at $0.1477, which could halt further losses. If buying interest increases, the price might test the nearest resistance level at $0.2199. Breaking through this level could lead to the second resistance at $0.256. On the downside, if the price falls below the nearest support, it could head toward the second support at $0.1116. Technical indicators provide mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index is at 41.60, suggesting that Dogecoin is approaching oversold territory. The Simple Moving Average over 10 days is $0.1745, slightly below the 100-day average of $0.1765. This indicates short-term weakness but also potential for a rebound. The MACD level is -0.0007965, reflecting bearish momentum, but the Stochastic at 42.62 may indicate that selling pressure is easing. Conclusion PEPE and DOGE are bullish, but XYZVerse’s unique sports-meme blend positions it for massive growth in the 2025 bull run.

1750252959,2025-06-18 21:22:39,"Bitcoin price could fall under $100k, options data suggests","Bitcoin price has retreated in the past few days, and the futures market points to more downside, potentially to $100,000. Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped to $104,650 on Wednesday, June 18, marking a 6.52% decline from its highest level this year. Option traders are increasingly betting on further declines. Data from Deribit shows that the put-to-call volume ratio rose to 2.17, indicating that more traders are buying put options as a hedge. A put option gives investors the right, but not the obligation, to sell an asset at a specific price within a defined time period. In this case, for contracts expiring on Friday, open interest in put options is concentrated at the $100,000 strike. Investors remain cautious amid the escalating crisis in the Middle East . In a statement on Tuesday, Donald Trump suggested the U.S. may enter the conflict and potentially target Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. You might also like: Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest dumps second batch of Circle shares The conflict could fuel inflation in the U.S. and globally. Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude prices rose to $76 and $74, respectively, while global shipping costs have also jumped. As a result, the Federal Open Market Committee may opt for a wait-and-see approach, monitoring the impact of geopolitical tensions and Trump’s proposed tariffs. On a more positive note, Bitcoin demand appears to be rising. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw over $216 million in inflows on Tuesday, bringing total cumulative inflows to $46.26 billion. In a note, an XBTO analyst said : “A hawkish signal from the Federal Reserve could strengthen the US dollar and trigger a test of the psychological $100,000 mark. The geopolitical situation remains a wildcard, where further deterioration would likely trigger another move down across risk assets.” Bitcoin price has formed a double-top pattern BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news On the eight-hour chart, BTC has pulled back from a high of $110,500 to around $104,530. It has formed a double-top pattern with a neckline at $100,300, a formation often associated with bearish breakouts. Bitcoin has also fallen below the 50-period Exponential Moving Average and is approaching the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. Meanwhile, the MACD indicator has dropped below the zero line. As such, Bitcoin may continue falling, with the next level to watch being $100,300, about 4.2% below current prices. A break below that support could open the door to a deeper decline toward the 38.2% retracement level at $97,560.

Here Are the Details,"The Blockchain Group (ALTBG), a Paris-based technology firm that positions itself as Europe’s first Bitcoin treasury company, has announced that it has added 182 more Bitcoins to its portfolio. The company’s latest purchase was worth around 17 million euros ($19.6 million). The Blockchain Group Continues Bitcoin Purchases: 182 More BTC Added, Bringing Total Value Over $170 Million With the latest purchase, the company's total Bitcoin holdings reached 1,653 BTC, with a total market value of approximately 149 million euros (approximately $171 million). The company also drew attention with its 1,173% “BTC yield” so far in 2025. This ratio is calculated by dividing the total amount of Bitcoin held by the company’s fully diluted share count. This metric is used to show how effective companies’ Bitcoin acquisition strategies are. For comparison, MicroStrategy (MSTR), the world’s largest institutional Bitcoin holder, reported a 19.1% BTC yield since the beginning of the year, while Japan-based Metaplanet (3350) reported a 266.07% yield and US-based Semler Scientific (SMLR) reported a 26.7% yield. Bitcoin Purchases Funded by Bond and Stock Proceeds The Bitcoin purchase was financed by a convertible bond issue worth more than €18 million, with investors including UTXO Management, Moonlight Capital, Ludovic Chechin-Laurans and asset manager TOBAM. The company also raised an additional €1.6 million by converting its stock purchase warrants into approximately 3 million new shares, and used this proceeds to purchase Bitcoin. The Blockchain Group’s Bitcoin purchases were made through Swissquote Bank Europe and Banque Delubac, while the crypto assets are being held in custody by Switzerland-based digital asset infrastructure provider Taurus. The company's average cost of Bitcoin purchases is around 90,000 euros (about $103,000). Following the news of the acquisition, the company's shares were traded on the Euronext Paris exchange in the morning hours, down 2.1% at 4,895 euros, while France's CAC 40 index remained flat. The Blockchain Group’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy makes it one of the prominent players in institutional crypto asset management in Europe. *This is not investment advice.

1750252812,2025-06-18 21:20:12,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Holders Defy Gravity, Signaling Potent Q3 Breakout","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Analysis: Holders Defy Gravity, Signaling Potent Q3 Breakout The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, and few assets capture the market’s attention quite like Bitcoin (BTC). Recently, observers have noted a fascinating shift in Bitcoin’s typical correlation patterns. Despite a backdrop of rising geopolitical uncertainty, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable stability, diverging from its usual behavior as a purely risk-on or risk-off asset. This unexpected resilience is a key point in understanding the current Bitcoin price analysis . Understanding Current Bitcoin Holder Behavior A significant factor contributing to Bitcoin’s current stability lies within the actions of its long-term investors. According to insights highlighted by Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, and reported by CoinDesk, extensive blockchain data indicates that seasoned BTC holders are largely maintaining their positions. There are minimal signs of widespread profit-taking, even as Bitcoin’s price has seen recent gains. This steadfast Bitcoin holder behavior is a powerful signal, suggesting conviction rather than caution among those who have held BTC through various market cycles. They aren’t just holding; they appear to be accumulating or at least refraining from selling into strength, which removes significant selling pressure from the market. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Market Outlook? This observed reluctance of long-term holders to sell is a crucial piece of the puzzle when assessing the broader Bitcoin market outlook . When large portions of the supply are held off-market by conviction holders, it naturally reduces the available supply for trading. This dynamic contributes directly to the ongoing period of price consolidation we are witnessing. Instead of volatile swings driven by quick profit-taking, the market is absorbing demand without a corresponding flood of sell orders from established participants. This consolidation phase, while potentially frustrating for short-term traders, is often viewed by analysts as a necessary period of building a strong base before a potential significant price move. Key takeaways from the current market structure: Reduced Selling Pressure: Long-term holders acting as ‘HODLers’ limit the supply entering the market. Price Consolidation: Demand is being met without significant price drops, leading to sideways movement. Foundation Building: This period allows the market to establish support levels and prepare for future moves. Divergence from Risk Assets: Bitcoin’s stability amidst geopolitical tension suggests maturity or unique market drivers. Is a Crypto Market Q3 Breakout on the Horizon? The stable foundation built during this consolidation phase, underpinned by strong Bitcoin holder behavior , has led many analysts, including Kuptsikevich, to eye the third quarter of the year for a potential breakout. The theory is that this prolonged period of stability is coiling like a spring. When a catalyst eventually arrives – whether it’s positive macroeconomic news, increased institutional adoption, or a significant technical level being breached – the reduced selling pressure from holders could allow the price to move upward more freely and rapidly. The Crypto market Q3 outlook is becoming a focal point for investors hoping for renewed bullish momentum. Potential catalysts for a Q3 move could include: Positive developments around Bitcoin Spot ETFs (flow data, new approvals). Changes in global monetary policy (e.g., interest rate decisions). Increased corporate or institutional investment announcements. Significant technical chart patterns completing their formation. Positive regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions. Considering Your BTC Price Prediction Strategy Given the current dynamics, what should investors consider when formulating their BTC price prediction or investment strategy? While no one can predict the future with certainty, the current market structure provides valuable clues. The strength shown by holders suggests underlying confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. However, potential challenges remain. Challenges to a Q3 Breakout Despite the optimistic signs, several factors could challenge or delay a potential breakout: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Unexpected global economic downturns or market crashes could still impact risk assets like Bitcoin. Regulatory Uncertainty: Negative regulatory news from major countries could dampen sentiment. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen global events could disrupt market stability. Whale Activity: While long-term holders are strong, concentrated selling from large individual or institutional wallets could still occur. Actionable Insights for Investors Based on this analysis, here are some points to consider: Monitor Holder Data: Keep an eye on on-chain metrics related to long-term holder supply and accumulation trends. Watch Key Technical Levels: Identify significant support and resistance levels that could signal the start of a breakout or breakdown. Stay Informed on Macro Events: Global economic and geopolitical developments can still influence the crypto market. Consider Your Time Horizon: The current environment seems favorable for those with a longer-term perspective, aligning with holder behavior. Risk Management: As always, invest only what you can afford to lose and consider diversification. Summary: Poised for Potential? In conclusion, the current Bitcoin price analysis reveals a market in consolidation, heavily influenced by the unwavering commitment of long-term holders. This strong Bitcoin holder behavior is providing a stable base, potentially setting the stage for a significant move. While the exact timing and direction are never guaranteed, the prevailing Bitcoin market outlook , supported by the potential for catalysts in the Crypto market Q3 , suggests that a breakout is a distinct possibility. Investors formulating their BTC price prediction should weigh the strong fundamental signal from holders against potential external challenges, positioning themselves wisely for what the coming months may hold.

With a limited presale supply and increasing price tiers, $AGNT offers early investors the potential for significant returns as adoption grows. The Codename:Pepe Community is Growing – Join the Mission Now! Dogwifhat: The Meme Coin Turning Heads in 2025's Crypto Market Dogwifhat (WIF) is a Solana-based meme coin gaining attention in 2025. Without a specific function, its value comes from community interest and market sentiment. With a limited supply of over 998 million tokens, it's viewed as a digital collectible. Since its start in December 2023, Dogwifhat has seen wild price swings. It hit a high of $4.85 in March 2024 but also dropped to a low of $0.0677. These fluctuations highlight the volatile nature of meme coins. Analysts have mixed views but often lean positive. Some predict Dogwifhat could reach $7.64 by 2030, with higher estimates up to $16.65 in 2025. These outlooks depend on ongoing community support. Though lacking utility, Dogwifhat's strength is its community and meme appeal. In today's market, sentiment matters, and WIF may draw investors. However, without features like token burning or staking, growth could be limited. Dogwifhat's future in 2025 is uncertain but intriguing. While facing challenges due to speculation, a strong community might push it higher. Investors should be cautious, considering its volatile history and the factors affecting meme coins. BONK Coin: Is the Solana-Powered Meme Token Ready to Soar in 2025? Bonk (BONK) is a meme coin built on the Solana blockchain. Unlike many meme coins that run on Ethereum, BONK leverages Solana's fast and low-cost transactions. This makes it an attractive option for users seeking quick payments and liquidity on the Solana network. Since its release in December 2022, BONK saw a significant surge in price alongside SOL. By 2025, the coin has experienced substantial growth, drawing attention from investors and crypto enthusiasts. However, its anonymous founders and a basic white paper have raised concerns among some experts. Supporters like Subhash Chandra believe BONK has room to grow, especially with the anticipated crypto bull market. They see ongoing giveaways and promotions as ways to attract new users and boost the coin's adoption on Solana. Critics like Peter Henn point to the lack of transparency and detailed plans as reasons to be cautious. Looking ahead, forecasts suggest BONK could continue its upward trend. Predictions for 2025 range from a low of $0.000036 to a high of $0.00009368. While these are optimistic, the coin's future will depend on market conditions and its ability to build trust within the community. In the current market cycle, BONK presents both opportunities and risks. Its alignment with Solana's growing ecosystem could propel it forward. However, potential investors should carefully consider the coin's fundamentals and the volatile nature of meme coins. Ethereum in 2025: The Future of Decentralized Innovation Ethereum is a blockchain platform that powers decentralized applications, or dApps, using smart contracts. These smart contracts run without central control, allowing secure and transparent transactions across industries. Ethereum's uniqueness lies in its vast ecosystem of tokens and applications. Developers can create tokens, enabling digital assets like stablecoins and governance tokens. Transactions still require Ether (ETH) for fees. Since its launch in 2015, Ethereum has grown significantly. The shift to Proof-of-Stake in 2022 reduced energy use and set the stage for upgrades. Sharding, aiming to improve scalability, promises faster, cheaper transactions. In 2025, Ethereum remains a leading platform for innovation. Its ongoing development and adoption suggest strong potential. Investors see promise in its technology and the demand for decentralized solutions. Analysts predict Ethereum's advancements could drive its value higher. With improvements and a robust ecosystem, it may continue to be attractive in the digital landscape. Conclusion WIF, BONK, and Ethereum have shown activity, but their short-term potential appears limited. Market conditions suggest these coins may not deliver significant gains in the immediate future. In contrast, Codename:Pepe crypto stands out by unleashing true intelligence for maximum profits. It employs artificial intelligence to identify promising meme coins, predict market trends, and provide exclusive AI-powered trading signals. With a community-driven approach and a capped supply of 5 billion tokens, Codename:Pepe crypto positions itself as the next meme coin poised for substantial growth.

1750252584,2025-06-18 21:16:24,China's central bank promotes blockchain and stablecoins as solution to payments,"People’s Bank of China (PBoC) governor, Pan Gongsheng, emphasized blockchain’s role and distributed ledgers for global payments at the Lujiazui Forum event on June 18. Pan said China will establish an international operation center for the digital RMB. This is to promote the international use of digital currency, strengthen financial market services, and support widespread digital finance innovations. Blockchain development in this area extends a wider trend, bringing tech capabilities for financial advancement. Pan Gongsheng highlights China’s position at the forefront of digital currency innovation The Lujiazui Forum , an event in the financial industry organized by China’s leading financial regulators and the Shanghai municipal government, focused on “financial opening-up and cooperation for high-quality development in a changing global economy.” During the event, key central financial regulators were expected to unveil important financial policies. Officials from top regulatory bodies like the National Financial Regulatory Administration and the China Securities Regulatory Commission attended. Notable speakers included Pan Gongsheng, Zhu Hexin (Deputy Governor of the PBoC and Director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange), Li Yunze (Minister of the National Financial Regulatory Administration), and Wu Qing (Chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission). Pan delivered a keynote address that blockchain speeds up the growth of stablecoins and changes cross-border payments. According to him, this technology is changing traditional systems by allowing instant settlements. However, the governor of the People’s Bank of China highlighted that the system also brings new challenges for regulations. The upgrade concerns smart contracts and decentralized finance, indicating an interest in moving payment systems forward without being dependent on traditional systems. Zhou Xiaoquan, the executive deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance, said that Shanghai will support central financial regulators to enhance China’s high-level financial openness gradually. The central bank’s digital currency stablecoin was also mentioned, which is believed to facilitate cross-border payments. Li Kexin, the deputy director of the PBoC’s general office, mentioned at a press conference in late May that the central bank is speeding up its efforts to boost policy reserves. This move aims to strengthen Shanghai’s position as an international financial center. Even with these important announcements, other global financial organizations did not give any direct replies. However, the spotlight on blockchain still continues to highlight China’s position at the forefront of digital currency innovation, according to the official agenda of the Lujiazui Forum. China’s innovation in crypto solidifies its position as a fintech leader in Asia China has a long history of leading in digital finance. Events like those held in Lujiazui often highlight important progress in blockchain and digital currency, strengthening China’s position as an Asian fintech leader. The Lujiazui Forum has shown how China’s financial growth has progressed for many years. The terms “reform” and “opening up” are important topics at the forum, featuring in the themes of almost half of its past sessions. As stakeholders, industry leaders and researchers discuss their views and ideas at the forum, they address concerns on how to handle the global financial crisis, ways for the financial sector to support the real economy better, issues with liquidity in Chinese banks, and methods to avoid systemic risks, among others. Analysts believe shifting to blockchain for payments might increase trust among institutions in cryptocurrency systems. This has the potential to develop stablecoins and is a strategic move for financial modernization in China. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

1750252570,2025-06-18 21:16:10,Will Universities Be Crypto’s Next Big Funding Driver?,"The recent announcement that venture fund Blockchain Builders had raised $28 million to finance promising crypto start-ups turned some heads. Not because $28m is a monumental figure in the context of crypto fundraising (it isn’t), but because of the fund’s many links to Stanford University. Founded by three Stanford graduates – Gil Rosen, Kun Peng, and Steven Willinger – it’s no exaggeration to say that Blockchain Builders bloomed from the corridors of the private research university. Indeed, the phrase “Stanford blockchain ecosystem” got plenty of play when the fund launched, a reference to things like the Center for Blockchain Research, the Stanford Blockchain Accelerator, and the BASS (Blockchain Application Stanford Summit) conference series. So, what does all of this mean? Why should we care that Stanford’s become a hub of blockchain research and innovation, and that the endeavors of its crypto community have led to the creation of a seven-figure fundraising chest? From Bold Visions to Real-World Applications Well, for starters, the very fact that one of the world’s most respected research institutions is turning its gaze to blockchain is a boon for the Web3 space. Between entrepreneurship courses and accelerators, Stanford is turning into a pipeline for crypto innovation. It also represents a proving ground for university involvement in the industry, giving rise to the possibility of prominent education institutions investing in Web3 firms and tech directly. In fact, reference has already been made to expansion of this nature: while the $28m chest was dubbed Fund I, and dedicated to investing in pre-seed and seed-stage blockchain ventures mostly focused on Stanford’s community, Fund II will support the new IC3-Cornell Blockchain Accelerator , “an initiative designed to transform bold ideas into real-world applications.” Interestingly, this research-driven program includes faculty members of Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley, Princeton, Yale, and University College London (UCL). In other words, some of the brightest minds in the university system are collaborating on developing blockchain-based solutions; on taking proof-of-concepts to the real world. Given academic institutions are already accustomed to deploying capital for various initiatives, it’s not a stretch to imagine them leveraging their talent pool and deep pockets to finance the next wave of Web3 innovation. We can only guess at how impactful this might be, though Blockchain Builders itself has already funded some exciting cutting-edge projects, from decentralized AI operating system 0g (co-founded by Stanford graduate students Michael Heinrich and Thomas Yao) to Nexus Labs, a decentralized network for verifiable cloud computing created by Stanford graduate Daniel Marin. The Institutions Have Arrived Institutional funding, of course, is already pushing the crypto industry forward: inflows from tradfi investors have poured into bitcoin and ether since the approval of spot ETFs last year. Market participants previously immune to crypto’s charms are now making digital assets a fixture of their portfolios. Meanwhile, the SEC is sifting through dozens of altcoin ETF applications. Last month, BTC funds attracted a net $5.5 billion while ETH funds posted a net $890 million per Coinshares data . All told, the value of crypto fund assets hit $167 billion in May, a sure sign that the industry is breaking new ground. Academic research into blockchain is one thing, but if the growth of the Stanford crypto ecosystem is any indication, initiatives with a financial focus could be the industry’s next major funding driver. Particularly if the richest Ivy League universities are behind them. Just as the arrival of ETFs legitimized digital assets in the eyes of many, the increased involvement of august institutions like Stanford and their scholars has strengthened their appeal.

Here’s the Destination,"On June 18, 2025, Whale Alert, a well-known blockchain transaction tracker, reported that Ripple transferred 200 million XRP, valued at approximately $438,999,244 at the time of execution, to an unidentified wallet. The movement was detected and broadcast via social media, where it gained additional attention following commentary from crypto influencer Amelie. The transfer occurred during a period of heightened scrutiny of Ripple’s activities, particularly as the company continues to face regulatory and public pressure related to its ongoing legal matters. Amelie published a tweet in response to the event, highlighting the precise amount and origin of the transfer. She stated that the funds were moved “from Ripple themselves” and questioned the purpose of the transfer, which lacked any accompanying explanation from Ripple. The transaction was verified via Whale Alert’s transaction monitoring interface and linked to the XRP Ledger . The recipient address has not been publicly linked to any exchange, custodian, or partner institution, intensifying uncertainty about its role.

The user expressed doubt about the company’s intentions and suggested that Ripple’s ongoing activity in the market contradicts the interests of XRP holders. Another user, Economicswizard, commented that the identity of the recipient wallet should be publicly disclosed, describing the lack of information as “shady.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Although Ripple routinely conducts monthly sales or redistributions from its XRP holdings , the lack of a formal announcement or designation for this particular transfer has prompted speculation. Neither Ripple nor any affiliated personnel has issued a clarification regarding the destination of the 200 million XRP. Blockchain records confirm that the receiving wallet has no known prior association with centralized exchanges or previously identified Ripple partner addresses. Ongoing Context: Legal and Regulatory Pressures Remain in Focus The transfer arrives during a critical legal phase involving Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Although both parties finalized and signed a settlement agreement—Ripple on April 23, 2025, and the SEC on May 8 —they are still awaiting approval from the district court. A joint motion under Rule 60(b) was filed on June 12 , seeking a ruling to allow the case to return from appeal for judgment modification. Presently, the Court of Appeals has paused proceedings until Judge Torres rules on the motion. Amid this unresolved process, market participants have been closely tracking Ripple’s movements. The lack of a clear explanation for the $438 million XRP transfer has led some to question whether the transaction relates to the pending settlement, internal liquidity management, or other undisclosed obligations. At the time of writing, no additional information has been made available about the receiving wallet or the reason for the $438 million equivalent transfer. As the blockchain ledger only records wallet addresses and amounts, further identification requires a statement from Ripple or the involvement of investigative tracking services.

1750252459,2025-06-18 21:14:19,Chinese E Commerce Giant JD.com Launches Stablecoin Initiative,"JD.com’s stablecoin strategy aligns with its broader ambitions to scale existing supply chain infrastructure internationally. This move was also announced amid global regulatory momentum, particularly in the US, where the Senate passed the GENIUS Act—a major legislative push to regulate stablecoins. The Act aims to enforce full asset backing, licensing, audits, and AML compliance, signaling Washington’s intent to dominate the digital dollar race. Meanwhile, Malaysia opened a digital asset sandbox, while China is setting up an international digital yuan hub. As stablecoins are being recognised as vital instruments for programmable, borderless finance, JD.com’s entry could be a pivotal moment in the global digital payments transformation. JD.com Enters Stablecoin Race Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com is entering the stablecoin space with an ambitious global strategy. Founder Liu Qiangdong announced plans during a media briefing in Beijing to apply for stablecoin licenses across major sovereign currency nations to facilitate faster and cheaper cross-border payments. Liu claimed JD’s stablecoin could cut payment costs by 90% and settle transactions within 10 seconds, which is a huge improvement over the traditional SWIFT system's two-to-four-day timeframe. Initially, the stablecoin will focus on business-to-business transactions, but JD.com envisions expanding into consumer payments in the future. Liu acknowledged that while the project could face setbacks or even fail, such risks are inherent in business ventures. The company is maintaining its core supply chain-focused strategy and does not intend to launch entirely new business models, but rather deepen its current business verticals and scale them internationally. JD.com’s move coincides with the broader momentum in the stablecoin sector, fueled by regulatory developments like the passage of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act in the US Senate. The landmark bill sets out federal guidelines for stablecoin issuance and usage. Though the GENIUS Act faces potential challenges in the House, its Senate approval is a critical step in US crypto regulation. Meanwhile, China is also ramping up its digital currency efforts. People’s Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng announced plans to establish an international digital yuan operations center in Shanghai to help reduce global dependence on the US dollar. JD.com has already been active in the space after using China's Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) system for employee salaries and cross-bank settlements since 2021. These developments come as industry leaders like Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire suggest that stablecoins are on the brink of a major adoption moment. While Allaire believes the sector has not yet reached its ”iPhone moment,” he pointed out the growing realization of the potential behind programmable digital dollars. JD.com’s stablecoin initiative may be an early step toward that inflection point. Malaysia Opens Doors to Stablecoin Testing Malaysia also recently made strides in the crypto sector after it launched the Digital Asset Innovation Hub , a regulatory sandbox that is designed to allow fintech and digital asset firms to test emerging technologies under the supervision of the country’s central bank. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced the initiative at the Sasana Symposium 2025 in Kuala Lumpur, and called it the start of a new chapter for the country’s digital economy. The sandbox will explore innovations like programmable payments, ringgit-backed stablecoins, and supply chain financing in a controlled environment, with the goal of aligning infrastructure, policy, and talent across public and private sectors to build a digitally capable Malaysia. (Source: Asean Business ) The initiative is part of a strategy to position Malaysia as a regional fintech leader. Central Bank Governor Abdul Rasheed Ghaffour believes in the importance of modernizing the nation’s financial systems, including efforts to upgrade the Rentas payment infrastructure, improve cross-border payment connectivity, and experiment with asset tokenization. These moves are seen as essential to keeping pace with the growing financial ecosystem. Earlier this year, Anwar also met with Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. Despite previous regulatory tension, Binance later gained access to the Malaysian market through a minority stake in MX Global, a firm operating under local regulations. Meanwhile, neighboring Singapore is taking a stricter approach to digital asset regulation. On May 30, the Monetary Authority of Singapore announced that entities providing digital token services to overseas markets must be properly licensed under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2022. Firms operating without a license were given until June 30 to cease operations, with no transitional grace period. Violators risk facing fines of up to 250,000 Singaporean dollars and potential prison sentences of up to three years. GENIUS Act Could Define Future of Digital Dollars In the US, The GENIUS Act is a landmark piece of legislation aiming to regulate stablecoins. So far, industry leaders have responded to the Act with cautious optimism. Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal recently pointed out the bill’s potential to bring long-awaited regulatory clarity, while others placed emphasis on the broader implications for the digital economy. Still, not all voices are supportive. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, warned the bill could facilitate abuse by entities tied to political interests. A key proposed amendment seeks to ban elected officials and their families from issuing stablecoins to try and address these concerns. If enacted, the GENIUS Act will create a regulatory framework requiring stablecoin issuers to register with the US government, maintain full 1:1 asset backing, submit to audits, and comply with Anti-Money Laundering standards. Supporters say the bill could help reinforce the dollar’s dominance in the digital age and provide a regulatory foundation that integrates blockchain with traditional financial systems. OKX US CEO Roshan Robert called it a “strong signal” that the US is taking a pragmatic approach to digital assets, and sees the legislation as a bridge between centralized and decentralized infrastructure. Stablecoins are often pegged to fiat currencies like the dollar, and are increasingly seen as key tools for low-cost, cross-border payments. The GENIUS Act could pave the way for broader use of programmable money and more seamless integration with global payment systems. Mike Cahill , CEO of Douro Labs, suggested the bill could legitimize stablecoins as an entirely new financial category, unlocking their potential across payments, settlements, and treasury operations. He added that the US has a chance to lead not only in crypto but in shaping the next global financial rulebook. Supporters also argue that embracing dollar-backed stablecoins could counter rising de-dollarization sentiment. As other nations seek alternatives to US financial dominance, stablecoins like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC may offer a modern pathway to strengthen the dollar’s global relevance. Bill Sebell of the XDC Foundation explained that by enabling anyone with a smartphone to access compliant digital dollars, the US could reinforce its monetary influence at a time when critics are predicting its decline.",https://coinpaper.com/9612/chinese-e-commerce-giant-jd-com-launches-stablecoin-initiative,News|Crypto

1750252298,2025-06-18 21:11:38,Russian Authorities Bust Massive $700K-a-Year Illegal Crypto Mining Farm Hidden as Industrial Plant,"Authorities in Russia have dismantled a large-scale illegal crypto mining operation in Nazarovo, a town in Krasnoyarsk Krai, exposing a scheme that reportedly generated over 4.6 million rubles ($58,000) per month. According to the post on Telegram by the Krasnoyarsk Krai Prosecutor’s Office, the mining farm was operating in plain sight. It was located on a 30,000-square-meter plot of state-owned land, registered on paper as hosting a non-residential building. In reality, no such structure existed. Russian Authorities Shut Down Unpermitted Mining Site Amid Grid Overload Fears The site, surrounded by barbed wire, was packed with mining rigs and power infrastructure. Prosecutors revealed that all equipment had been leased to a third party under the pretense of renting space in the non-existent building. The company behind the operation had no right to use the land and never obtained necessary permits. Making matters worse, the miners had connected directly to the town’s power grid without approval. The unauthorized use of electricity raised risks of outages and safety hazards. Local energy officials warned of a high probability of emergency blackouts. Authorities also cited fire safety violations and a failure to comply with public safety standards. Despite a warning from prosecutors, the company continued operations. A court has since ordered the immediate suspension of the facility. The prosecutor’s office is monitoring enforcement. The shutdown adds to growing concerns over illegal crypto mining in Russia, even as the country continues to embrace the sector legally. In 2023, Russia legalized mining and introduced a taxation framework expected to generate billions of rubles annually. However, due to power constraints, mining has been restricted in certain Siberian regions , including parts of Krasnoyarsk. While legal in most of Russia, many operators avoid registration and high electricity costs by tapping directly into the grid or using residential rates. These tactics can damage infrastructure and endanger communities. Russia's power grid took a $14M hit from illegal #CryptoMining in 2024. Authorities crack down on unauthorized operations, imposing bans & stricter regulations. #Blockchain #Russia https://t.co/DDxLOdJIVE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 18, 2025 Earlier this year, an energy company employee in Krasnoyarsk was caught accepting bribes to overlook similar illegal mining connections. In that case, miners reportedly stole electricity worth over 9 million rubles ($119,000). Russia Battles Mining Thefts and Crypto Malware Attacks Elsewhere, in Russia’s Republic of Buryatia, a separate operation was discovered just days ago. During a routine inspection on June 14, authorities found 95 mining rigs hidden inside a KamAZ truck, connected to a 10-kilovolt line meant to power a nearby village.

According to Rosseti Siberia’s Buryatenergo unit, this was the sixth mining-related electricity theft in the region since January. Officials say such operations risk damaging local grids and triggering blackouts. Crypto mining is banned in most of Buryatia between November 15 and March 15 to conserve power during the winter. Only registered entities in certain districts can operate outside that window. The crackdown reflects wider federal action. In late 2024, the Russian government prohibited mining during peak energy periods in several regions, including Dagestan, Chechnya, and areas of eastern Ukraine under Russian control. Since April, a full ban has been in place in Irkutsk , one of Russia’s top mining hubs. Companies like BitRiver, which operates major data centers in Irkutsk, are heavily affected by the changes . The region hosts some of Russia’s cheapest electricity and has become central to the country’s mining industry. However, a recent r eport has surfaced that a sophisticated hacking group has been turning Russian business computers into hidden crypto mining machines while stealing sensitive financial data, according to a new report by Kaspersky. The group, known as Librarian Ghouls (also called Rare Werewolf or Rezet), has been conducting a dual-purpose attack that installs unauthorized Monero mining software and extracts cryptocurrency wallet credentials and private keys. The campaign, active through May 2025, has primarily targeted industrial firms and engineering schools across Russia and the CIS region.

1750252288,2025-06-18 21:11:28,Best Crypto to Buy in June 2025: 3 Crypto Coins to Buy Right Now,"The post Best Crypto to Buy in June 2025: 3 Crypto Coins to Buy Right Now appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News June marks the end of Q2, and as the second half of the year slowly rolls in, investors are positioning to grab the best offers that will reap the best return on investment by the year’s end. Sentiment is shifting, cryptocurrencies are gaining momentum, and bold investors are preparing for the next wave. If you want to make a smart move right now, Little Pepe, Hyperliquid, and Solana are three names that stand out. They are flashing green, and their fundamentals are backing them up for a bullish phase. Little Pepe: The Meme Chain Revolution We Didn’t See Coming It started as a whisper in the degen corners of Crypto Twitter. Now it’s exploding into a full-blown movement. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a first-of-its-kind Layer 2 blockchain built entirely for meme coins. Supported by a team of anonymous legends from the meme coin trenches, Little Pepe was born in the swamps of Solidity and raised in the jungles of JavaScript. This isn’t some fly-by-night project; it’s a carefully coded, meme-fueled beast aimed at disrupting the most chaotic aspects of the crypto sector. Let’s talk tech. Little Pepe boasts a gasless L2 chain with its own validator network. That means: Blazing-fast transactions Ultra-low fees Zero tax on buys and sells The world’s only sniper-bot protection at the blockchain level That last part is a game-changer. For too long, launch bots and snipers have killed meme launches before they even start. Little Pepe has built-in tools to stop that, making it the safest place to launch a meme coin. But it doesn’t stop there. The team is also rolling out Pump Pad, a decentralized launchpad built into the chain. This launchpad is designed to enable meme developers to launch fair, fast, and bot-free. It’s plug-and-play for anyone ready to spin up the next $PEPE or $DOGE without being front-run or rugged. The market is responding in a significant way. Little Pepe’s presale is already a massive success, with over 740 million tokens sold and over $765,000 raised so far. It currently sells for $0.0011 in stage two, with the price set for $0.0012 in the next stage. The devs aren’t holding back either. They’ve announced a $777,000 giveaway, with $77,000 each going to 10 lucky degens just for participating . Little Pepe is proving to be more than a meme. It’s a movement, a chain, a cultural shift in the way we view meme coins. There’s only one route it can take, and that’s the one to success. The presale is moving fast, and now is the best time to get in if you don’t want to miss out on early gains. Hyperliquid (HYPE): A Breakout in Progress HYPE 1wk Price Chart| TradingView Hyperliquid (HYPE) is quickly becoming the poster child for DeFi 2.0, and the charts prove it. After bouncing off the $36.50 level, HYPE has now broken out of the consolidation bullish range near $42.50. The key resistance? $44.22. A clean break above that could ignite a sharp rally toward $47.50 or even higher. HYPE has broken past this resistance, trading at $44.25 at the time of this writing. It needs to hold above it to confirm the breakout. What really sets HYPE apart, though, is momentum. The MACD is bullish, but the RSI is above 70, indicating that a potential short-term pullback may occur soon. The Breaks of Structure (BOS) and a Change of Character (CHoCH) suggest smart money is positioning for a leg up. Analyst Altcoin Sherpa supports this in his post on X , where he says HYPE has ‘insane strength.’ According to him, the token is consolidating around highs while preparing for a fresh leg up that will push it beyond $50. A confirmed breakout could take it to new all-time highs fast. Solana (SOL): Institutional Tailwinds Are Building SOL/USD 1wk Price Chart|TradingView Solana (SOL) has rallied 8% today, breaking past $55 and heading for $160. While the broader market cools off, Solana is preparing for what could be its biggest wave of institutional adoption yet. Seven heavyweight asset managers just updated their Solana ETF filings with the SEC. The kicker? These filings now include staking language, suggesting funds may offer yield on top of exposure. Analyst James Seyffart says this development echoes the early rumblings of the spot Bitcoin ETF saga. Approval might not come tomorrow, but the groundwork is being laid. Meanwhile, Bybit’s upcoming Solana-based DEX, Byreal , adds fuel to the fire, proving that Solana is becoming the go-to blockchain for both CeFi and DeFi convergence. Technically, SOL is still trading inside a large ascending channel. A breakout above this formation could trigger a rapid move to $500. Long-term projections from some traders even target $1,000. Conclusion: This Trio Could Define Summer 2025 The crypto market doesn’t wait for anyone, and the best opportunities usually come when you least expect them. Little Pepe has meme momentum and breakout potential. Hyperliquid is a technical setup begging for liftoff. Solana is quietly accumulating institutional plays that could redefine its valuation. Together, these three assets cover the speculative, the technical, and the foundational. These narratives are in motion and could be your best bet for June.

1750252208,2025-06-18 21:10:08,Binance Alpha Spotlights TAG and JANITOR: Discovering Early Stage Crypto Gems,"BitcoinWorld Binance Alpha Spotlights TAG and JANITOR: Discovering Early Stage Crypto Gems In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, staying ahead means keeping an eye on where innovation is brewing. Binance, a leading name in the industry, offers various avenues for users to explore the digital asset landscape. One such avenue is Binance Alpha , a platform integrated within the Binance Wallet designed to shine a light on promising, early-stage crypto projects before they potentially hit the main exchange. What is Binance Alpha and Why Does it Matter? Binance Alpha serves as a discovery layer, providing visibility to projects that are still in their nascent stages but have demonstrated potential through community activity and market interest. Think of it as an incubator or a spotlight for emerging tokens within the broader Binance ecosystem. It’s a space where users who are actively exploring new opportunities might find projects worth researching further. The significance of Binance Alpha lies in its connection to the world’s largest crypto exchange. While inclusion on Alpha is explicitly *not* a guarantee of a future listing on the main Binance exchange, it does signal that these projects have caught the attention of the platform’s research and discovery teams. For users, it offers a curated list of projects that have met certain preliminary criteria, saving them some legwork in sifting through countless new tokens. Key aspects of Binance Alpha: Part of the Binance Wallet infrastructure. Focuses on early stage crypto projects. Selection based on factors like community engagement and market trends. A discovery tool for users interested in emerging assets. Distinct from a main Binance exchange listing. Spotlight On: The TAG Token and JANITOR Token Additions According to reports circulating in crypto communities, specifically highlighted by the Telegram channel New Listings Feed, Binance Alpha has recently added two specific tokens to its showcase: the TAG token and the JANITOR token . These additions mean that users exploring the Binance Alpha section within their Binance Wallet might now see information related to TAG and JANITOR. While the original announcement is brief, it points to these projects having met Alpha’s internal criteria for inclusion at this stage. For holders or potential investors of the TAG token and JANITOR token , this visibility within the Binance ecosystem is a notable development, even if it doesn’t directly impact their liquidity or tradability on the main exchange. Details about TAG and JANITOR themselves are typically minimal in these early announcements, encouraging interested users to perform their own in-depth research into the projects’ whitepapers, teams, technology, and community traction. How Are Early Stage Crypto Projects Selected for Binance Alpha? The selection process for Binance Alpha is not as stringent or public as the process for a full Binance exchange listing. However, the core criteria mentioned typically revolve around: 1. Community Engagement: A strong, active, and growing community is often a key indicator of a project’s potential and resilience. This can be measured through activity on social media platforms, Telegram or Discord groups, forums, and the level of participation in project initiatives. 2. Market Trends Among Emerging Projects: Binance Alpha’s team likely monitors sectors and narratives gaining traction within the broader crypto market. Projects that align with these trends, whether it’s DeFi, NFTs, GameFi, specific Layer 1 or Layer 2 solutions, or other innovative use cases, might be considered if they show promise within their niche. These criteria highlight that Binance Alpha is looking for projects that have already built some momentum and have a clear direction, rather than completely unproven concepts. The inclusion of the TAG token and JANITOR token suggests they have demonstrated these qualities to some degree. Understanding Early Stage Crypto: High Potential, High Risk Investing in early stage crypto projects, whether discovered through platforms like Binance Alpha or elsewhere, comes with significant opportunities and risks. These projects are often in active development, with smaller market caps and potentially higher growth ceilings if they succeed. However, they also face substantial challenges: Execution Risk: Can the team deliver on their roadmap? Market Adoption Risk: Will the product or service gain traction and users? Competition: Are there other projects doing similar things better or faster? Liquidity Risk: It can be difficult to buy or sell large amounts of tokens without significantly impacting the price. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto is still evolving. Scam Risk: Unfortunately, the early-stage environment can attract fraudulent projects. This is why the disclaimer that inclusion on Binance Alpha does not guarantee a main exchange listing is crucial. A main listing involves a much deeper dive into the project’s fundamentals, legal standing, security, and long-term viability. Binance Alpha is more about initial discovery and visibility for projects that show early signs of promise. What Does This Mean for Users and the TAG/JANITOR Communities? For users of the Binance Wallet and those following new crypto projects, the addition of the TAG token and JANITOR token to Binance Alpha provides a potential signal. It suggests these projects have reached a certain level of development and community interest to be recognized by a platform associated with Binance. For the communities behind TAG and JANITOR, this is positive news as it increases their visibility within a major crypto ecosystem. It could potentially attract new users and attention to their projects, fueling further community growth and development. However, it is absolutely critical for anyone encountering these projects via Binance Alpha to conduct thorough due diligence. Research the project’s goals, technology, team, tokenomics, and community activity independently. Do not view the Binance Alpha listing as an endorsement or a guarantee of future success or a main Binance listing. Looking Ahead: The Path from Early Stage to Mainstream? While the addition to Binance Alpha is a positive step for the TAG token and JANITOR token , their journey is far from over. The path to becoming a widely adopted or listed asset on major exchanges is long and challenging. Continued development, community building, achieving milestones, and adapting to the market are all necessary steps. Platforms like Binance Alpha play a valuable role in bridging the gap between truly unknown projects and potential mainstream recognition. They offer a structured way for promising early stage crypto projects to gain initial exposure within a trusted environment, while providing users with curated options for discovery within their Binance Wallet . The crypto market is dynamic, and keeping an eye on platforms like Binance Alpha can offer insights into emerging trends and projects gaining traction. Just remember to approach any early-stage project with a mindset of thorough research and awareness of the inherent risks. Conclusion: Binance Alpha’s Growing Showcase The inclusion of the TAG token and JANITOR token on Binance Alpha highlights the platform’s ongoing role in identifying and showcasing early stage crypto projects. This move, reported via community channels, brings increased visibility to these specific assets within the Binance Wallet environment, based on their community engagement and alignment with market trends. While a positive development for the projects and a discovery opportunity for users, it’s crucial to reiterate that being on Binance Alpha does not equate to a future listing on the main Binance exchange. Users interested in these or other early-stage projects should always conduct their own comprehensive research (DYOR – Do Your Own Research) to understand the potential benefits and significant risks involved.

There is a surge of bitcoin treasury companies that focus on accumulating bitcoin and following strategies similar to Strategy. Although the Prenetics acquisition is small by comparison to firms spending hundreds of millions of dollars on BTC, the firm said it has board approval to substantially increase its bitcoin holdings and aims to become one of the largest healthcare corporate bitcoin holders globally, in a press statement on Wednesday. “What excites me most is not just Bitcoin as a treasury asset, but the convergence we're witnessing between healthcare innovation and blockchain technology,” said Danny Yeung, CEO of Prenetics. “We're at the dawn of a new era where genomics, personalized medicine, and digital assets will intersect in ways that could revolutionize how we approach human health, longevity and wealth.” Earlier this week, H100 Group (H100), a Swedish health-technology company, announced a 750 million kronor ($79 million) transaction to support its long-term bitcoin BTC treasury strategy. Prenetics also announced the appointment of Andy Cheung, former COO of OKEx, to its Board of Directors.

1750252052,2025-06-18 21:07:32,Nasdaq-Listed Eyenovia Raises $50M to Build First US Public Company HYPE Treasury – $100 Target Realistic?,"Nasdaq-listed Eyenovia becomes the first US publicly traded company to establish a dedicated HYPE treasury reserve, raising $50 million through a private placement to accumulate over 1 million tokens of Hyperliquid’s native cryptocurrency. The announcement triggered a massive 134.68% surge in Eyenovia’s stock price. Source: Google Finance The strategic pivot comes just days after HYPE established a new all-time high of $44.86 , pushing its market capitalization to $14.876 billion and solidifying its position as the 8th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Eyenovia’s bold treasury strategy follows in the footsteps of Tony G Co-Investment Holdings, which recently acquired 10,387 HYPE tokens for $438,000 , marking the beginning of what appears to be a broader institutional adoption wave. The company also plans to rebrand as “Hyperion DeFi” with a new ticker symbol, “HYPD.” It also appoints crypto veteran Hyunsu Jung as Chief Investment Officer to oversee the treasury. At the time of writing, HYPE is trading above $40. Source: Cryptonews Corporate Treasury Revolution: From Bitcoin to HYPE Eyenovia’s treasury strategy is part of a growing trend of Altcoins struggling for market share, similar to Cardano’s recent intent announcement of a $100M ADA treasury . However, Solana co-founder later slammed Cardano’s idea . Solana’s @aeyakovenko challenges Cardano’s proposal to convert ADA treasury to Bitcoin. #Solana #Cardano https://t.co/5zBW8i3Szh — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 16, 2025 It moves beyond the traditional Bitcoin and Ethereum allocations that have defined institutional crypto strategies since MicroStrategy’s groundbreaking moves in 2020. The company’s comprehensive approach involves token accumulation and active participation in Hyperliquid’s validator network, potentially generating substantial staking rewards while contributing to network security and decentralization. This validator strategy mirrors successful models employed by Sol Strategies. Under Tony G’s leadership, Sol Strategies has built a commanding position in the Solana ecosystem . With this strategy, publicly traded companies have generated multiple revenue streams from strategic crypto positions. The financial structure of Eyenovia’s transformation is particularly unique. The $50 million private placement involves issuing non-voting convertible preferred stock convertible into approximately 15.4 million shares at $3.25 per share, alongside warrants for an additional 30.8 million shares at the same exercise price. If fully exercised, the warrants could generate total proceeds of $150 million, providing Eyenovia with substantial capital to expand its HYPE holdings and acquire additional positions in complementary DeFi protocols. Technical Analysis Supports $100 Price Target Thesis From a technical perspective, HYPE’s chart structure presents compelling evidence supporting ambitious price targets that could vindicate Eyenovia’s treasury bet within the next six to twelve months. The daily chart reveals a massive cup-and-handle pattern that has been forming over several months. The cup bottomed around $9.32 in March, and the recent breakout above $35.13 represents the completion of this major accumulation phase. Source: BallaJi on TradingView The pattern’s measured move projects initial targets at $55 and extended objectives reaching $79.73, though Elliott Wave analysis suggests even more ambitious possibilities. The macro cup pattern’s geometric price channels indicate HYPE remains well within its bullish trajectory despite recent consolidation around $40.39 following the all-time high breakthrough. The asset has successfully converted previous resistance levels into support, with the $35.17 zone now serving as a critical foundation for the next advance phase. The completion of the cup-and-handle typically indicates the beginning of explosive moves, particularly when accompanied by fundamental catalysts like institutional treasury adoption, which create sustained demand pressure. Source: TheCryptoHare on TradingView Hourly timeframe analysis reveals classic post-breakout consolidation characteristics, with HYPE establishing multiple bounces above the converted support zone and showing signs of bull flag formation. The recent advance from historical accumulation levels around $10-12 represents nearly 300% gains, yet momentum indicators suggest the asset is building energy for continuation rather than showing exhaustion signals. Technical projections using Fibonacci extensions support the $67-$102 range as realistic targets if the current wave structure completes as anticipated.

1750251975,2025-06-18 21:06:15,Spot Ripple (XRP) ETFs Are Going Live in North America Today: Details,"While the US Securities and Exchange Commission continues to delay making a decision on some of the numerous spot XRP ETF filings, its Canadian counterpart has already approved a couple. One of them is launched by 3iQ, while the other comes from Purpose Investments. 3iQ Corp’s XRPQ The press release from 3iQ Corp informs that the financial vehicle, going with the XRPQ ticker, will be available for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange from today, June 18. Moreover, it will debut with a 0% management fee for the first six months. The announcement reads that XRPQ will invest only in “long-term holdings for XRP purchased from reputable digital asset trading platforms and over-the-counter (OTC) counterparties,” while the underlying asset will be secured in standalone cold storage. “The launch of XRPQ marks another milestone in our mission to provide investors with convenient, cost-effective access to digital assets within a regulated framework,” said Pascal St-Jean, President and CEO of 3iQ. The company’s exec added that the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has demonstrated “significant growth potential over the past decade, and this groundbreaking strategy offers Canadian and qualified global investors a transparent, low-cost, and tax-efficient way to securely access that opportunity.” Purpose Investments’ XRPP In a separate announcement , the asset investment company with over $24 billion in AUM, Purpose Investments, said it has expanded its spot crypto ETF portfolio by launching the Purpose XRP ETF. It will also trade on the TSX, and its ticker is XRPP. Paul Pincente, VP of Digital Assets at the company, said the new financial vehicle is a “streamlined, advisory-ready solution that transforms XRP’s real-world utility into a secure, investable format.” “Canadian investors continue to look for simple, safe, and transparent ways to access the digital asset market, and the XRP ETF has been one of the most requested digital assets in our lineup, thanks to XRP’s design for fast, low-cost global payments,” said Vlad Tasevski, Chief Innovation Officer. While Canada will have a couple of spot XRP ETFs, its southern neighbor continues to delay making a decision on many of the numerous SEC filings. Just yesterday, the nation’s securities watchdog postponed its decision on Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF application. However, it also invited public comments on CBOE’s proposal.

1750251823,2025-06-18 21:03:43,"Block3’s AI is forging the future of gaming, one prompt at a time","The gaming industry, a powerhouse of entertainment and innovation for decades, has recently found itself navigating turbulent waters. In this challenging landscape, Block3 , an AI-powered gaming engine, is poised to redefine how games are made and experienced. Mass layoffs have swept across studios , development costs for blockbuster titles have soared into the hundreds of millions, and a perceived lack of innovation, coupled with an over-reliance on monetisation strategies like microtransactions and battle passes, has left many players feeling disenfranchised. The signs of strain in the gaming industry are undeniable. The early to mid-2020s saw a wave of significant job losses. While a few years ago, a major title might cost $50-150 million to produce, some now exceed $300 million. This financial pressure leads studios to prioritise established intellectual properties, often at the expense of novel and experimental projects. How Block3 works: from prompt to play Block3 uses the latest AI technology to bring gamers and game developers the means to create any games they would like. The fundamental mechanism is remarkably simple yet incredibly powerful: users provide text prompts, and Block3 transforms these prompts into fully playable, AAA-quality game titles in mere seconds. This “infinite creation” capability is driven by advanced generative AI models. Block3 achieves this with its Trinity model, a gaming model that will be trained through a distributed network. Trinity’s training contributors will be compensated through blockchain-based incentives. Unlike traditional game development, which requires painstaking manual creation of assets, environments, and code, Block3’s AI can interpret descriptive language and synthesise entire game worlds. Imagine typing “Create a futuristic cyberpunk city with flying cars and a bustling marketplace,” and the engine instantly generates the detailed 3D models, textures, animations, and even basic gameplay mechanics to match. This automation extends across various game elements, from environmental design and character models to soundscapes and narrative suggestions. How Block3 will be a game-changer The recent advancements in AI models that can generate videos from simple text prompts, seen in various emerging tools, perfectly illustrate the underlying technology Block3 harnesses to bring dynamic visual experiences to life almost instantaneously. Block3 represents a monumental disruption to the traditional gaming industry model. Legacy studios often grapple with development cycles stretching five years or more, and budgets regularly exceeding $100 million for a single title. Block3 dramatically shortens this timeframe to mere seconds of prompt input, slashing development costs to virtually zero on the creation side. This unparalleled efficiency will democratize game development, empowering individuals and small teams to create experiences that were once the exclusive domain of multi-million dollar corporations. Furthermore, Block3 integrates a tokenised ecosystem, anchored by the BL3 token. This token governs creation fees, facilitates asset trading within the Block3 universe, and enables revenue sharing, offering investors a liquid stake in this transformative shift. The BL3 token’s presale starts on June 26, Thursday. Block3’s production also becomes its training data as each user-generated game will be used for this. This will make a feedback loop of recursive AI improvement. By merging AI generation, crypto rails, and open-world gaming, Block3 establishes itself as a first-mover, uniquely positioned to capture the immense upside of the projected $665 billion AI x Gaming future. This means not only a revolution in how games are made, but also in how they are owned, distributed, and monetised, shifting power from legacy studios to a more decentralised, user-driven creative economy. The gaming industry has already seen $51 billion in inflows in recent years. Around $244 billion is expected to be invested in AI technology. Block3 combines the best of these tech titans and provides democratisation to the gaming industry.

1750251659,2025-06-18 21:00:59,Forex Market Tumultuous: Asia FX Muted by Geopolitical Tensions & Fed Outlook,"BitcoinWorld Forex Market Tumultuous: Asia FX Muted by Geopolitical Tensions & Fed Outlook For those tracking global markets, including cryptocurrency investors, understanding the traditional Forex Market is crucial. Currently, we are seeing a period where Asia FX is notably muted, trading within tight ranges. This lack of significant movement comes amidst brewing concerns over rising Geopolitical Tensions in the Middle East and anticipation surrounding the next moves from the Federal Reserve . Let’s break down these key factors influencing currency valuations right now. Why is Asia FX Muted? Navigating Geopolitical Crosscurrents The relative calm in Asian currencies is a direct reflection of market caution. The recent escalation in tensions between Israel and Iran has injected a significant degree of uncertainty into the global financial system. While direct impacts on Asian economies might seem distant, the potential for wider conflict disrupts supply chains, energy markets, and overall investor sentiment. In times like these, traders often prefer to wait and see, leading to lower trading volumes and narrower ranges for regional currencies. Several factors contribute to this cautious stance in Asia FX : Risk Aversion: Heightened geopolitical risk typically prompts investors to move away from perceived riskier assets, including some emerging market currencies in Asia. Oil Price Sensitivity: Many Asian economies are significant importers of oil. Rising oil prices due to Middle East tensions can negatively impact their trade balances and inflation outlook, putting pressure on their currencies. Uncertainty’s Grip: The unpredictable nature of geopolitical events makes it difficult for market participants to take strong directional bets, resulting in range-bound trading. US Dollar Weakens: What’s Behind the Dip Ahead of the Federal Reserve? Interestingly, while Asia FX remains subdued, the US Dollar has shown signs of weakening recently. This might seem counterintuitive given its traditional safe-haven status during times of global stress. However, the dollar’s recent performance is heavily tied to expectations surrounding the Federal Reserve . The market is closely watching for clues on the timing and pace of potential interest rate cuts by the Fed. Recent US economic data, such as inflation reports and employment figures, have painted a mixed picture, leading to speculation that the Fed might be closer to easing monetary policy than previously thought. Lower interest rates in the US would make dollar-denominated assets less attractive compared to those in other countries, reducing demand for the dollar. Key drivers for the dollar’s recent weakness include: Shifting Rate Cut Expectations: Any indication that the Fed might cut rates sooner or more aggressively weighs on the dollar. Yield Differentials: As other central banks potentially hold rates higher or signal future hikes, the yield advantage of US bonds diminishes, impacting the dollar. Technical Factors: After periods of strength, the dollar can also experience technical corrections as traders adjust positions. The Federal Reserve’s Critical Influence on the Forex Market The Federal Reserve holds immense power over the Forex Market , particularly concerning the US Dollar . Its monetary policy decisions, primarily interest rate adjustments and quantitative easing/tightening programs, directly affect the supply and demand dynamics for the dollar globally. When the Fed raises interest rates, it generally makes the dollar more attractive to foreign investors seeking higher returns on their investments, increasing demand for the dollar. Conversely, when the Fed lowers rates, it can lead to capital outflow and a weaker dollar. The market spends considerable effort analyzing every statement and data point released by the Fed to anticipate its next move. Understanding the Fed’s potential actions is vital for anyone involved in the Forex Market , as it sets the tone for many currency pairs involving the US Dollar . The current phase of anticipation is creating volatility not just for the dollar itself, but also indirectly for currencies like those in Asia FX , which are influenced by dollar strength or weakness. Geopolitical Tensions: A Persistent Factor in the Forex Market Landscape While central bank policies like those of the Federal Reserve are fundamental drivers, Geopolitical Tensions provide a layer of unpredictable volatility in the Forex Market . Events in the Middle East are a prime example, but tensions can arise anywhere in the world and quickly impact currency valuations. How do these tensions affect the market? Safe-Haven Flows: During times of crisis, investors often flock to currencies traditionally considered safe havens, such as the US Dollar (though its recent weakness complicates this), the Swiss Franc, and the Japanese Yen. Impact on Commodity Currencies: Countries whose economies rely heavily on commodity exports (like oil or metals) can see their currencies fluctuate significantly based on how geopolitical events affect global commodity prices. Disruption of Trade and Investment: Tensions can disrupt international trade and reduce foreign investment, negatively impacting the currencies of affected nations or regions like Asia FX . The current environment is a complex interplay between these geopolitical concerns and the market’s focus on the Federal Reserve ‘s policy path, creating a challenging landscape for predicting currency movements. Understanding the Broader Forex Market Picture Bringing it all together, the current state of the Forex Market reflects the confluence of these powerful forces. Asia FX is cautious due to regional and global uncertainty from Geopolitical Tensions . The US Dollar is under pressure as the market speculates on potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve . These elements don’t exist in isolation; they constantly influence each other. For instance, significant geopolitical events could force the Fed to reconsider its policy stance, or changes in the Fed’s outlook could alter how markets react to geopolitical news. This interconnectedness is a defining characteristic of the global financial system. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Current Market Given this complex backdrop, what can market participants consider? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on both geopolitical developments and signals from the Federal Reserve . Risk Management: Volatility can increase quickly. Employ robust risk management strategies if trading currencies. Look Beyond the Headlines: Understand how these macro factors translate into potential movements in specific currency pairs, including those involving Asia FX and the US Dollar . In conclusion, the Forex Market is currently navigating a period marked by the quiet caution in Asia FX , the weakening trend in the US Dollar , the looming influence of the Federal Reserve , and the persistent uncertainty from Geopolitical Tensions . This environment demands careful observation and a nuanced understanding of how these powerful forces interact to shape currency valuations globally.

1750251568,2025-06-18 20:59:28,"Top AI Tokens Boom $10B This Week, FET‑AGIX Alliance Gains Traction & Meme‑AI Plays Take Over—AGNT Codename: Pepe Is the Presale Wildcard You Didn’t See Coming","AI tokens are making headlines with a surge in value, adding $10 billion this week alone. The emergence of an alliance between Fetch.ai and SingularityNET has captivated investors. Meanwhile, meme-inspired projects are generating buzz, with Codename: Pepe standing out. As a high-potential player, its mission involves leveraging humor and AI to capture significant gains. NEAR, FET, and other such digital assets are riding this bullish wave alongside innovative projects. Codename: Pepe aims to challenge traditional tokens by harnessing AI for strategic trading insights. This project, inspired by notable meme coins, relies on community support for success. The intrigue surrounding its presale has caught the attention of those seeking new opportunities. Codename:Pepe Unleashes True Intelligence for Maximum Profits The crypto underworld is infested with fake AI agents—shady operators promising “next-gen intelligence” while barely outsmarting a toaster. This nonsense ends today. Codename:Pepe has come to denounce fake AI agents. This ultimate undercover agent does not pretend, it is actually doing something useful: helping you make money in the chaotic meme coin jungle. Codename:Pepe is on a mission of mass hilarity (and, naturally, ridiculous gains). Classified Intel: The True Identity of Codename:Pepe Keep this under wraps: Codename:Pepe is a Pepe in disguise. Modeled after the legendary PEPE coin, which skyrocketed nearly 22,000%, this covert operative has the same ambition. Will it succeed? That depends on its community. Your Directive: Secure Your Position in the Code name:Pepe Mission Unlike VC-backed rug pulls, Codename:Pepe is powered by the people. The bigger the support, the higher it moonwalks. That’s why it has chosen the community-driven presale strategy with a smart plan: Entry Price at Stage One: $0.003333333 (because three is a lucky number) Final Stage Price: $0.151515152 (because round numbers are boring) First-Stage Discount: 98% Translation: Buy early, pay less. Codename:Pepe Mission Explained Codename:Pepe plans to use the power of artificial intelligence to hunt down the juiciest meme coins, predict market trends, and deliver exclusive AI-powered trading signals before the FOMO kicks in. Beyond smart analysis, this genius agent will also trade for you with its fully automated AI-trader, turning those signals into sweet gains. Every great agent needs an elite organization backing them. That’s where $AGNT comes in. Holding $AGNT unlocks membership in a top-secret DAO, where operatives (investors) gain access to classified strategies, insider analytics, and the ability to vote on high-stakes missions. Holding $AGNT will unlock: Membership in a top-secret DAO Access to classified strategies Insider analytics Ability to vote on high-stakes missions Profits from the mutual DAO fund will be allocated to those who stake their $AGNT, ensuring the spoils of the trade go to the most loyal agents. Top-Secret Tokenomics (No Funny Business) This is a community-first operation, so 25% the total token supply is allocated for staking and rewards. Codename:Pepe isn’t just throwing tokens around like confetti. The supply is capped at 5 billion, ensuring no surprise inflation bombs. Further breaking down the tokemonics, only 20% of the supply is allocated for the presale. The offer at a discounted price is limited. Final Orders: Deploy Capital & Secure Your $AGNT Now This is your shot to join crypto’s most ridiculous yet lucrative mission. The best entries go to the fastest trigger fingers. Don’t be the guy who “wished he got in early.” The mission is set. The presale is live. Are you in, or will you let the AI fakes win? Buy Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Early for a Bigger Discount NEAR Protocol's Price Declines: Will It Bounce Back? NEAR Protocol (NEAR) has experienced a significant price drop. In the past week, its price fell by 11.96%. Over the last month, it declined by 16.60%. Looking back six months, the price has decreased by a substantial 60.65%. The current price ranges between $2.01 and $2.58, putting it close to its nearest support level at $1.80. This proximity to support might signal a potential rebound. The nearest resistance level is $2.94. If the price moves from its current low of $2.01 up to the resistance, it would be an increase of about 46%. Falling to the support level from the current price would be a drop of around 10%. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 35.93, which is near the oversold threshold. This could suggest that the selling pressure is easing and a price increase might follow. However, given the downward trends over the past weeks and months, it's uncertain if the price will rise or continue to fall. FET Nears Oversold Zone After 52% Drop — Rebound Ahead? FET has experienced a downward trend recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by 13.96%. In the last month, it fell by 8.43%. Over six months, the drop was significant at 52.27%. Currently, the price ranges between $0.62 and $0.81. The nearest support level is at $0.54. This suggests that if the price continues to fall, it might stabilize at this point. The nearest resistance is at $0.92. If the price begins to rise, breaking through this level could signal further growth. With a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 37.79, FET is nearing oversold territory. An RSI below 30 indicates an oversold condition, which can suggest a potential rebound. This means that FET might be undervalued at the moment. To reach the resistance level of $0.92 from the current $0.81, the price would need to increase by about 13.6%. From the lower end of its current price range at $0.62, it would require a surge of approximately 48%. Market watchers are observing these levels to gauge FET's next movement, as it could either find support and rise or continue its downward trend. Conclusion While established tokens like NEAR, FET, and AGIX have shown promise, their short-term potential appears limited in the current market surge. Investors seeking immediate gains may find these options less appealing compared to emerging alternatives. Codename:Pepe crypto stands out by offering real intelligence to navigate the meme coin market for maximum profits. By leveraging AI to identify lucrative opportunities and automate trades, it positions itself as a valuable asset for those looking to capitalize on the bullish trend.

1750251376,2025-06-18 20:56:16,"Ethereum price outlook: $3,200 or $1,587 as 39-day range nears breakout","Ethereum has now traded in a tight range for over a month, with neither bulls nor bears taking full control. As price compresses and volatility stalls, the setup becomes increasingly primed for a strong directional move, but which way will it break? For the past 39 days, Ethereum ( ETH ) has been locked between two critical high time frame levels, with price action failing to produce a definitive trend. This prolonged consolidation signals one of two potential outcomes: an accumulation phase before continuation higher, or a distribution phase that leads to a breakdown and deeper correction. Key technical points: Range Duration: Ethereum has been range-bound for 39 days. Key Support: $2,400 (confluence of high time frame structure, moving averages, and POC). Key Resistance: $2,870 high time frame resistance. Bullish Breakout Target: Above $2,870 toward $3,200+. Bearish Breakdown Target: Loss of $2,400 opens a path to $1,587. ETHUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView At present, Ethereum is holding above the $2,400 mark, a critical support zone. This level carries significant technical confluence: it aligns with the current point of control (the highest traded volume area within this range), long-term moving averages, and past support levels. As long as Ethereum continues to close above this zone, the bullish case remains slightly favored, with the potential for a move above the $2,870 resistance. A breakout above that level would likely confirm the consolidation as accumulation, potentially triggering a rally into the low $3,000s. You might also like: BlackRock buys $1.4B Bitcoin over six-day streak amid ETF boom However, if $2,400 is lost, the bearish scenario takes precedence. A sustained breakdown below this key support would shift structure decisively in favor of the bears and open the door to a move toward the next major support around $1,587, a level last visited during prior market corrections. Importantly, price action currently sits in what can best be described as no man’s land, neither clearly bullish nor bearish. The consolidation continues, and the market awaits either a surge in volume or a catalyst to resolve this range. Traders must remain patient and let the market reveal its direction. What to expect in the coming price action Ethereum remains in a tightly coiled structure, with neither side asserting dominance. Until the $2,400 support is lost or the $2,870 resistance is broken, this range is expected to persist. Traders should wait for a confirmed breakout or breakdown before committing to directional positions.

1750251323,2025-06-18 20:55:23,Ripple (XRP) vs SEC: Legal Expert Predicts When Judge Torres Will Make A Ruling,"Ripple Labs may finally be approaching the end of its years-long courtroom battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to legal expert Fred Rispoli, the recent Supplemental Letter filed by Ripple in support of its Motion for an Indicative Ruling could trigger the next—and possibly final—phase of the case. While not the most forceful filing, Rispoli believes it addresses key concerns that could tip the scales in Ripple’s favor. Rispoli Reacts to Ripple’s Supplemental Letter Ripple’s filing was first disclosed by former federal prosecutor James K. Filan. In a detailed reaction, Fred Rispoli shared on X, “At 1.5 pages, this is not the strongest attempt—but it’s an attempt.” Despite its brevity, Rispoli argued that the letter addresses three long-standing gaps that Ripple had to confront. The first issue, he explained, is the role of the appellate court in the overall outcome. “The district court isn’t the end-all of this case, appellate courts are—and this ends ‘appellate risk,’” Rispoli said. This suggests Ripple is making it clear that any ruling from Judge Torres could be formalized through appellate remand, effectively minimizing future procedural uncertainty. At 1.5 pgs, this is not the strongest attempt–but it's an attempt. This concisely addresses three issues that were so obviously unaddressed that Ripple finally realized it had to say something: (1) the district court isn't the end-all of this case, appellate courts are–and… https://t.co/vwjR0Fbntb — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) June 17, 2025 The second issue revolves around the injunction placed on Ripple. Rispoli clarified, “Nothing is really being changed by dissolving the vanilla injunction—the summary judgment ruling remains and Ripple cannot break the law regardless of the injunction.” With the court already ruling in 2023 that XRP programmatic sales are not securities, the injunction has little legal weight left. Lastly, Rispoli pointed out that Ripple’s predicament differs from that of other crypto firms targeted by the SEC. “Ripple is only in this situation (as opposed to the majority of other SEC targets) because SEC chose Ripple years before its attacks on the other industry players,” he noted. This context emphasizes the unique burden Ripple has faced as an early target of the Commission. Optimism Builds as Timeline Narrows While he admitted he’s “still underwhelmed,” Rispoli said he is “feeling more optimistic,” adding that this move “may push us over the line.” That line, of course, is a ruling from Judge Torres that could signal the beginning of the end for the legal standoff. Not guaranteed, but highly likely Torres makes a ruling this week or next. If that happens then SEC and Ripple will file with 2nd Cir asking it to remand to make Torres indicative ruling formalized well before 8/15. As it stands, 8/15 is just a status report deadline. — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) June 17, 2025 When asked by a community member @KRN_CRYPTO whether the parties and the public would have to wait until August 15 for a decision. Rispoli responded, “Not guaranteed, but highly likely Torres makes a ruling this week or next. If that happens, then SEC and Ripple will file with [the] 2nd Cir[cuit] asking it to remand to make Torres’ indicative ruling formalized well before 8/15. As it stands, 8/15 is just a status report deadline.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This clarification is crucial: the August 15 date , widely misinterpreted as a ruling deadline, is simply a reporting checkpoint. If Judge Torres acts sooner, it could set off a chain reaction of procedural filings that lead to the case’s closure before that date. What Happens After a Favorable Ruling? When asked whether a positive ruling from Judge Torres would end the lawsuit entirely, Rispoli responded with a nuanced explanation. “Substantively but not formally,” he said. “A positive ruling from Torres means parties tell 2nd Cir[cuit] about [the] positive ruling, 2nd Cir[cuit] remands to Torres, Torres makes indicative ruling formal, parties then show 2nd Cir[cuit] the formal ruling, request dismissal… then case over.” Essentially, the court of appeals must remand the case back to Torres so she can formally implement the ruling. Only after both parties return to the appellate court with that final judgment can they move for a full dismissal of the case. Final Phase in Sight While the procedural steps that follow are technical, the substance of the matter may be resolved very soon. Judge Torres’ anticipated ruling could mark a major turning point, not only for Ripple but for the broader crypto industry watching closely. As Rispoli put it, “This may push us over the line.” If the court rules in Ripple’s favor within the expected timeframe, the SEC v. Ripple saga , which has defined regulatory discourse in crypto since 2020, may soon reach its long-awaited conclusion.

Now, a newcomer named XYZVerse aims to join their ranks in the meme coin arena. Can XYZVerse compete with these established giants? This article delves into its potential to challenge for supremacy in the world of meme cryptocurrencies. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $14 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.003333. At the next 13th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.005, meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits From Meme to Market: The Rise and Potential of Dogecoin Dogecoin started in 2013 as a playful spin on cryptocurrencies. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it used the Shiba Inu meme for its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no cap on its total supply. What began as a joke quickly turned serious when, in 2021, Dogecoin's value soared. Social media buzz, especially tweets from Elon Musk, helped propel it into the top ten cryptocurrencies, with its market value topping $50 billion. This showed how a strong community and online influence can shake up financial markets. Dogecoin's technology is based on Litecoin, making transactions fast and cheap. Its abundance means it's often used for tipping and small payments. While some see it as a novelty, others believe its active community could drive future growth. In the current market cycle, where established coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum face competition from newer projects, Dogecoin stands out for its simplicity and widespread recognition. As cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, Dogecoin could benefit from its friendly image and accessibility. However, like all cryptocurrencies, its value can be volatile, and it's important to stay informed about market trends. Shiba Inu Coin: How a Meme Became a Crypto Contender Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a joke, inspired by Dogecoin, but it's carving its own path. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain. This gives it access to Ethereum's vast ecosystem. With an initial supply of one quadrillion tokens, half were sent to Ethereum's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin. He donated a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply. These actions boosted SHIB's profile and trust within the crypto community. Unlike Dogecoin, which runs on its own blockchain, SHIB benefits from Ethereum's technology. This allows for projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where users can trade tokens. There's also talk of a future platform for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and a governance system where holders can have a say in decisions. In the current market, SHIB stands out because it's more than a meme; it's building real utility. As the crypto market evolves, coins that offer more features and integration may attract more attention. PEPE: The Memecoin Frogging Its Way to the Top PEPE is a new memecoin that hopped onto the Ethereum blockchain. Inspired by the famous Pepe the Frog meme from the early 2000s, PEPE aims to join the ranks of top meme-based cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. With a no-tax policy and a simple approach, it keeps things pure and fun. In late April to May 2023, PEPE saw a huge surge. Its market cap reached $1.6 billion, turning early holders into millionaires. This sparked what some call a ""memecoin season,"" with other memecoins pumping and dumping spectacularly. Looking ahead, PEPE has a three-phase roadmap. The first phase focuses on getting listed on CoinMarketCap and trending on Twitter. The second phase aims for listings on centralized exchanges. The third phase plans for ""tier 1"" exchange listings and a ""meme takeover."" While PEPE lacks utility, its charm lies in its community and meme appeal. In the current market cycle, with many waiting for the next Bitcoin halving and a potential bull run, PEPE could ride the wave of meme enthusiasm. Compared to other coins, its simplicity and connection to a beloved meme might make it attractive to those looking for the next big thing in the crypto world. Conclusion While DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE have dominated the meme coin market, XYZVerse aims to surpass them by uniting sports fans in a unique crypto ecosystem.

In one corner, Pi Network continues to fuel debate with its uneven market trajectory and stalled mainnet deployment. In another, Qubetics , with its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, represents a bold shift in how physical value is brought on-chain. This article addresses the Pi price prediction 2025 analysis and pairs it with a technical evaluation of Qubetics’ tokenized asset strategy—two stories that together highlight where blockchain utility and speculation collide. Can Pi Network Rebound? What the Pi Price Prediction 2025 Models Are Saying Throughout the summer and fall of 2025, predictive models illustrate a pattern of month-to-month volatility that creates both hesitation and hope. In June, Pi is expected to fall by roughly 12.5%, averaging $0.4801. Bearish signals point to a low of $0.4216, suggesting possible downside risk of up to 30%. However, short-term pessimism gives way to renewed optimism in July, when the coin may recover to $0.4729—a gain of 18.7% from its projected floor. August extends this upward momentum, albeit modestly. Analysts predict a move to $0.4659, providing a monthly potential of over 19%. September follows with a slightly lower median value of $0.4397, but still signals a constructive trend shift compared to earlier lows. The overall tone remains cautiously optimistic, despite the absence of fundamental breakthroughs from the network itself. October maintains a tight range with projected highs of $0.4589 and an average price of $0.4498. While incremental, this marks an expected increase of 2.3% month-over-month. November brings stronger movement, with Pi forecasted to reach $0.4748. The potential return stands close to 18%, reflecting stable trading volumes and renewed interest in Pi’s long-awaited mainnet. Closing out the year, December projections settle around $0.4838. Though the figure indicates a year-end dip of -19.6% from current prices, a closer look shows that most models still suggest gains for those entering at predicted lows. The takeaway: Pi Network’s 2025 path may be rocky, but its monthly swings could offer calculated openings for those tracking sentiment and data-driven models. Tokenized Real-World Assets: How Qubetics Is Reshaping Market Fundamentals Qubetics is rewriting what blockchain infrastructure can deliver. Central to its model is the Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace—a powerful feature that offers banks, financial institutions, and independent entities the ability to tokenize real-world assets and trade them on-chain. This system is more than a conceptual framework. Qubetics enables entities to create native tokens representing real estate, intellectual property, commodities, or even digital rights, each one verifiably linked to a tangible asset. Once tokenized, these units are brought onto the Qubetics blockchain, where they can be bought and sold seamlessly. With tokenized assets, liquidity improves dramatically. Previously illiquid properties or contracts can now be fractionally owned, traded globally, and settled without third-party delay. For those in finance or asset management, this is a structural upgrade to how capital markets could function. The Qubetics Tokenized Asset Marketplace acts as the trading layer for these innovations. Users gain access to a diverse catalog of verified tokens, each backed by real-world value and transparently recorded. Qubetics Crypto Presale: The Final Countdown to Listing Momentum behind Qubetics is building quickly as its public sale nears its end. The protocol is currently in Stage 37 of its crypto presale , with the price fixed at $0.3370 per $TICS token. With over 516 million tokens sold and more than $18 million in total sales, market confidence is trending upward. A key development recently announced involves the total supply reduction from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion $TICS. This strategic supply cut introduces built-in scarcity, a design move that positions the asset for price acceleration upon listing. Coupled with a recalibrated allocation that now grants 38.55% of the supply to public participants, Qubetics is visibly shifting its focus toward community governance. With fewer than 10 million tokens remaining in the presale pool, interest is spiking. Experts monitoring the protocol suggest a 20% price surge at listing, driven by constrained supply and increasing institutional attention. Qubetics Price Prediction: What $15,000 Could Become on the $TICS Timeline As momentum builds, some are exploring what a $15,000 allocation might yield based on realistic listing and post-mainnet scenarios. At the current price of $0.3370, such an entry would purchase approximately 44,503 $TICS tokens. Should the token launch at $0.40, the holding value would climb to $17,801—an immediate increase of $2,801. If $TICS hits the $1 milestone, that original $15,000 grows to $44,503. A price surge to $5 elevates this to $222,515. And if the ecosystem matures to support a $10 valuation post-mainnet, that figure balloons to $445,030. The most optimistic projection, at $15 per token, represents a valuation of $667,545. These figures hinge on several real-world factors, including adoption of the tokenization platform, successful exchange integration, and sustained network security. Conclusion: Pi Price Swings vs. Protocol Evolution Pi Network offers a fascinating case study in potential versus execution. Its forecasted price patterns through 2025 reflect a community that is still waiting on long-promised utility. While algorithmic forecasts suggest modest gains, the asset remains heavily sentiment-driven, reacting more to hopes than hard updates. Qubetics , on the other hand, is crafting a future built on real-world integration and token utility. Its tokenized asset marketplace provides a scalable blueprint for how blockchain can extend beyond speculation. Coupled with a final-stage presale and a dramatically reduced supply, its fundamentals suggest long-term viability and near-term growth.

What is the Pi price prediction for 2025 based on? The predictions use algorithmic models factoring in recent performance, market sentiment, and volume trends. 2. What makes Qubetics different from other crypto presale projects? Its asset tokenization platform targets real-world use cases, offering tangible value beyond speculation. 3. How is Qubetics creating scarcity in its ecosystem? By reducing its total token supply from 4 billion to 1.36 billion, and increasing community distribution. 4. Why is Pi Network still considered speculative? Despite its popularity, it has yet to fully deploy its mainnet or deliver consistent utility updates. 5. Is tokenized asset trading already live on Qubetics? Not yet, the marketplace should be live after the mainnet launch, supporting real-world digital assets, enabling transparent, liquid trading environments.

In the meantime, BTC’s price continues to feel the consequences of yet another global turmoil as it fell below $105,000 earlier today. As reported yesterday, the POTUS made some critical remarks on the Iran-Israel conflict, indicating that the US intelligence knew where Tehran’s Supreme Leader hid. Trump called Khamenei an “easy target,” but said he is safe for now. However, the US President demanded that Iran surrender unconditionally. Cited by several media outlets, Khamenei refused Trump’s proposition, saying that his country will not surrender. Moreover, Iran’s Supreme Leader warned that there will be “irreparable harm” if the US further backs Israel and joins the attacks. A White House official confirmed yesterday that Trump and Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, spoke on the phone while the US continues to build up military forces in the region. In the past few days alone, the US has sent a third Navy destroyer in the Mediterranean Sea, and a second carrier strike group is heading toward the Arabian Sea. So far, though, the Pentagon has denied that these moves are anything more than “purely defensive” operations. Bitcoin’s price slumped yesterday after Trump’s statement, and has failed to stage a meaningful recovery. It’s unlikely to do so in the near term as the tension in the Middle East continues to escalate. BTCUSD.

1750250239,2025-06-18 20:37:19,Iran warns citizens to delete WhatsApp on Meta data sharing with Israeli intelligence claims,"Iran told its people on Tuesday to get WhatsApp off their phones, warning that Meta—the US tech company run by Mark Zuckerberg—is handing over their personal information to Israeli intelligence. This warning came straight from Iran’s state broadcaster as the country escalates both verbal and military attacks against Israel. The report claimed Meta apps, including WhatsApp and Instagram, are grabbing user data like location and contact info, then tagging names and passing everything to Israel. The broadcaster called Israel the “Zionist enemy.” They gave no proof. Meta fired back fast. WhatsApp released a statement calling the claims “false” and said none of it was true. “We’re concerned these false reports will be an excuse for our services to be blocked at a time when people need them the most,” the company said. WhatsApp explained that all chats are protected with end-to-end encryption, which means not even the company can read messages. “All of the messages you send to family and friends on WhatsApp are end-to-end encrypted, meaning no one except the sender and recipient has access to those messages, not even WhatsApp.” Officials disrupt internet as fears grow over cyberattacks Online access across Iran has collapsed. Pages crash, calls drop, and messages won’t deliver. Commentators inside and outside the country said it’s not a coincidence. The government is restricting the internet again, and people inside Iran are noticing. The slowdowns are widespread, not random. Analysts said this is likely the government’s way of controlling the spread of information during a tense period of military activity. Iran is also worried about incoming cyberattacks from Israel, and some believe the state is cutting access to reduce the risk of infiltration. Meta didn’t stop at denying the spying claims. The company said it doesn’t even track precise locations. WhatsApp also said it doesn’t scan or store messages and has no agreement to send “bulk information to any government.” The encryption system, which locks every message between sender and receiver, is designed to prevent even spy agencies from accessing chats. Meta’s response came within hours of Iran’s accusation, but the broadcaster kept repeating the claims across multiple programs that day. The real story isn’t just about WhatsApp. It’s about how Iran is trying to control narratives and suppress communication. The warnings from the state broadcaster came while Iran faces a real danger of escalation with both Israel and the United States. WhatsApp and Instagram are the country’s top apps. Despite constant blocks and slow speeds, Iranians still use them to send messages, post updates, and spread news. The government knows this. That’s why the warning came now, not earlier. Khamenei threatens the US while Trump calls for unconditional surrender Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, took the fight beyond just tech platforms. On Wednesday, he warned the United States that any military action would be met with massive consequences. “Any American military entry will undoubtedly be met with irreparable damage,” he said, in remarks confirmed by NBC News. Khamenei added that Iran will never give in to pressure. “The Iranian people will firmly stand against an imposed war, just as they will stand firm against any imposed peace. This nation will never surrender to imposition from anyone.” Khamenei said Iranians can’t be forced to surrender. President Donald Trump had written on Truth Social Tuesday that US patience is “wearing thin.” He called Khamenei an “easy target,” then added, “We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now.” Trump said he doesn’t want missiles flying at civilians or US troops, but made it clear what the administration wants from Tehran: “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!” As for the WhatsApp situation, the government hasn’t banned the app officially yet. But the warning broadcast on state TV may be the first step. Iran has already banned Instagram in the past. And there’s been talk inside parliament about making the WhatsApp block permanent unless Meta shares internal data with Iranian officials. Meta said it won’t do that. The company hasn’t commented on whether they expect a total ban, but the tension isn’t going away. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability.

While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity From Meme to Market: The Rise and Potential of Dogecoin Dogecoin started in 2013 as a playful spin on cryptocurrencies. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it used the Shiba Inu meme for its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no cap on its total supply. What began as a joke quickly turned serious when, in 2021, Dogecoin's value soared. Social media buzz, especially tweets from Elon Musk, helped propel it into the top ten cryptocurrencies, with its market value topping $50 billion. This showed how a strong community and online influence can shake up financial markets. Dogecoin's technology is based on Litecoin, making transactions fast and cheap. Its abundance means it's often used for tipping and small payments. While some see it as a novelty, others believe its active community could drive future growth. In the current market cycle, where established coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum face competition from newer projects, Dogecoin stands out for its simplicity and widespread recognition. As cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, Dogecoin could benefit from its friendly image and accessibility. However, like all cryptocurrencies, its value can be volatile, and it's important to stay informed about market trends. Shiba Inu Coin: How a Meme Became a Crypto Contender Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a joke, inspired by Dogecoin, but it's carving its own path. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain. This gives it access to Ethereum's vast ecosystem. With an initial supply of one quadrillion tokens, half were sent to Ethereum's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin. He donated a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply. These actions boosted SHIB's profile and trust within the crypto community. Unlike Dogecoin, which runs on its own blockchain, SHIB benefits from Ethereum's technology. This allows for projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where users can trade tokens. There's also talk of a future platform for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and a governance system where holders can have a say in decisions. In the current market, SHIB stands out because it's more than a meme; it's building real utility. As the crypto market evolves, coins that offer more features and integration may attract more attention. PEPE: The Memecoin Frogging Its Way to the Top PEPE is a new memecoin that hopped onto the Ethereum blockchain. Inspired by the famous Pepe the Frog meme from the early 2000s, PEPE aims to join the ranks of top meme-based cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. With a no-tax policy and a simple approach, it keeps things pure and fun. In late April to May 2023, PEPE saw a huge surge. Its market cap reached $1.6 billion, turning early holders into millionaires. This sparked what some call a ""memecoin season,"" with other memecoins pumping and dumping spectacularly. Looking ahead, PEPE has a three-phase roadmap. The first phase focuses on getting listed on CoinMarketCap and trending on Twitter. The second phase aims for listings on centralized exchanges. The third phase plans for ""tier 1"" exchange listings and a ""meme takeover."" While PEPE lacks utility, its charm lies in its community and meme appeal. In the current market cycle, with many waiting for the next Bitcoin halving and a potential bull run, PEPE could ride the wave of meme enthusiasm. Compared to other coins, its simplicity and connection to a beloved meme might make it attractive to those looking for the next big thing in the crypto world. Conclusion While DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE have soared, XYZVerse aims for 20,000% growth, uniting sports and memes to become the new leader in the memecoin market.

In a new analysis published June 18, crypto analyst Quantum Ascend (@quantum_ascend) offered a fresh take on ADA’s price structure, warning that the final leg of a downward five-wave Elliott pattern may now be unfolding—with a critical resolution point drawing near. How Low Can Cardano Crash? “We dropped down into that second wave… and had it highlighted, it bounced from there. So we did call that correctly,” the analyst began, referencing earlier predictions. But despite the brief bounce, he now sees a more extended impulse playing out. “It does look like we’re turning this into more of a five-wave move down. So one, two, three, four, and working on a fifth wave now,” he explained while analyzing the one-day chart of ADA.

Quantum Ascend pointed out that ADA currently hovers around the 0.702 retracement level, with the 0.786 level lying just beneath it—both key zones often associated with deeper corrections in Elliott Wave theory. “Makes complete sense for us to go ahead and drop in right to this area at the very minimum,” he noted. Yet despite the grim technicals, the analyst maintains that no structural damage has occurred—at least not yet. “As long as we hold the 51 cent level, nothing’s broken, it’s not a problem, right?” he reassured. The broader context, however, is less encouraging: “We need Bitcoin to catch a little bit of a bid or Ethereum or something. We need some kind of good news to come in to alleviate a little bit of this because the market’s just pretty much been bleeding… for over a month now.” ADA has underperformed relative to its peers since early May, with sentiment sliding alongside price. But Quantum Ascend encouraged viewers not to overreact to the current downtrend. “All it is is an opportunity to dollar cost average,” he said, before addressing the exhaustion many long-term holders are feeling. “I know what you’re saying, QA. I’ve been dollar cost averaging for seven months. I get it. I’ve been there.” Related Reading: Nasdaq Says Yes To Cardano: ADA Earns A Spot Among Crypto Giants Rather than panic-sell or obsess over day-to-day moves, the analyst recommended mental distance and patience. “Go do something fun, it’s beautiful, it’s summer. Go do something else, anything else. But this thing is gonna resolve itself and alt season is around the corner,” he said. Despite short-term bearishness in the chart, his long-term conviction remains intact. “World War III is not starting. I could not have more conviction in all those things.” With ADA potentially entering the final leg of a corrective structure and broader markets searching for a catalyst, all eyes are now on whether support zones hold—or if Cardano is headed even lower before the long-awaited resolution finally arrives. At press time, ADA traded at $0.6158.

1750249816,2025-06-18 20:30:16,Why Is The Crypto Market Going Down Today?,"The crypto market is witnessing a broad-based decline as of June 18, 2025, with major assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP registering notable losses. This downturn is being driven by a complex mix of geopolitical fears, macroeconomic uncertainty ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy decision, and a wave of leveraged liquidations. Despite recent institutional inflows into ETFs, overall sentiment remains fragile, with volatility expected to persist in the near term. Geopolitical Tensions Spark Risk-Off Sentiment One of the primary drivers behind today’s selloff is the sharp escalation in Middle East tensions. Israeli airstrikes on Iranian facilities, including the Natanz nuclear site have ignited concerns of a wider conflict involving major global powers. Iran’s retaliatory military posturing, coupled with the possibility of U.S. involvement, has sent investors fleeing risk assets. BTC, ETH & XRP price decline (Source: TradingView) Cryptocurrencies, often regarded as high-risk instruments, have not been spared.

1750249812,2025-06-18 20:30:12,Special Assistant to Trump Holds XRP and Cardano (ADA): Details,"Since President Trump’s return to office, the tone from Washington toward digital assets has changed markedly. The approach to regulatory clarity, blockchain infrastructure, and national strategy has shifted from hostility to structured support. The White House now appears more openly aligned with the crypto sector than at any previous point in U.S. history. New financial disclosures show that this alignment may extend beyond policy. Thorgersen Thomas, a Special Assistant to the President and Director of the White House Travel Office, holds personal investments in XRP and ADA, two major digital assets. More Pro-crypto Staff in the White House This information was found in his official financial disclosure, where he reported assets valued between $1,001 and $15,000 in each of the two tokens, stored in a Coinbase wallet. The filing also notes that Thomas earned between $2,501 and $5,000 in income from his XRP holdings, while ADA generated income below the reporting threshold of $201. Thorgersen Thomas was appointed to his current role on January 21, one day after President Trump’s 2025 inauguration. Though the amounts are relatively modest, their presence signals an alignment between his personal financial decisions and the administration’s broader digital asset agenda. Trump’s Support for the Crypto Market The information was first shared on X by key voices within the XRP community, including King Solomon (@IOV_Owl) and Good Morning Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto). The presence of pro-crypto staff in the White House is notable because of Trump’s openness toward digital assets. UPDATE: Special Assistant To President Trump Holds $XRP & $ADA ! https://t.co/XSR5kYUldF pic.twitter.com/Nyra7kPHVR — Good Morning Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) June 16, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The president announced plans for a national crypto reserve less than two weeks after his inauguration. Meanwhile, President Trump’s son Eric Trump has hinted at plans to remove capital gains taxes on U.S.-based cryptocurrencies. Trump has also held multiple meetings with industry leaders, including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. These developments suggest a level of positive governmental interest in blockchain technologies not seen in past administrations. A Clearer Direction from the White House The Trump administration supports cryptocurrency. It has introduced policy frameworks aimed at reducing regulatory uncertainty, including the first-ever crypto-related law to reduce unnecessary overreach and freeing up market participants. Given these moves, it is not surprising that members of the President’s inner circle would have personal exposure to digital assets. It reinforces the notion that cryptocurrencies are no longer viewed as fringe or speculative at the highest levels of government.

China plans to expand the digital yuan globally with a Shanghai center. Officials urge a multi-currency system to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. The governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), Pan Gongsheng, delivered a powerful message on the future of finance, stating that blockchain technology and the rise of stablecoins are fundamentally transforming global payment systems while creating new regulatory hurdles. Blockchain Advances Payments, Raises Oversight Concerns On Tuesday, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) governor stated that blockchain technology is playing a key role in reshaping traditional financial systems. Speaking at the Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai, he noted that blockchain is speeding up the development of stablecoins and enabling faster, more efficient cross-border payments.

1750249624,2025-06-18 20:27:04,"Crypto Price Analysis 6-18: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, UNISWAP: UNI, CELESTIA: TIA, BITTENSOR: TAO","The crypto market registered a substantial drop as markets turned bearish after Bitcoin (BTC) , and most cryptocurrencies retreated as geopolitical tensions intensified. The upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision also impacted market sentiment. BTC dipped to a low of $103,567 as selling pressure intensified. However, the flagship cryptocurrency has recovered to reclaim $105,000 and move to current levels. BTC is down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours, trading around $105,490. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) is down nearly 2%, trading around $2,538 as it struggles to stay above $2,500. Ripple (XRP) is down over 3%, and Solana (SOL) fell below the $150 mark after dropping nearly 4%, trading around $148. Dogecoin (DOGE) is also trading in the red, with the price down 1.30%, while Cardano (ADA) is down 2.32%, trading around $0.618. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Litecoin (LTC) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines. Dow Jones Down As Swift End To Israel-Iran Conflict Ruled Out The Dow Jones and other US stock indices fell as hopes for a quick resolution to the Israel-Iran conflict faded. The Dow Jones fell 130 points on July 17, with healthcare firms leading the decline. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 dropped 0.44% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.50%. The market downturn began after US President Donald Trump called for the evacuation of Iran’s capital, Tehran, signaling an escalation of the conflict. President Trump has taken a hardline stance on Iran’s nuclear disarmament instead of pushing for a ceasefire, a demand the country is likely to reject. Oil prices have also spiked 3%, with investors worried a prolonged conflict could impact the region’s oil production, supply, and trade. Israel has already attacked major oil facilities in Iran, with the latter considering a closure of the Strait of Hormuz. Market watchers believe a prolonged conflict could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates sooner than expected. BBVA Suggests Clients Make Crypto Allocations BBVA (Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria), Spain’s second-largest bank, has advised its affluent clients to invest in crypto. The bank told its clients to invest between 3% and 7% of their portfolio into crypto and Bitcoin (BTC) , depending on their desired risk exposure. Philippe Meyer, the head of digital and blockchain solutions at BBVA Switzerland, stated at a conference in London, “With private customers, since September last year, we started advising on Bitcoin.” He also stated that portfolio allocation has been increased to accommodate riskier profiles. Meyers claimed the bank’s clients have been receptive to its advice and dismissed concerns that BTC and other crypto assets were too risky. “If you look at a balanced portfolio, if you introduce 3%, you already boost the performance. At 3%, you are not taking a huge risk.” The bank’s push comes amid growing warnings from European Union regulators and its central bank about the risks involved in cryptocurrencies. 95% of banks operating in the European Union are avoiding crypto. Thailand To Exempt Capital Gains Tax On Crypto For Five Years Thailand has announced it will exempt capital gains taxes on cryptocurrency sales through locally licensed crypto asset service providers for five years. The Ministry of Finance confirmed the announcement on Tuesday, stating that capital gains taxes will be waived on crypto transactions between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2029. The decision comes after Vietnam introduced legislation to define cryptocurrencies legally. The new legislation will come into effect on January 1, 2026. Thailand is not the first country to offer crypto investors a tax incentive. Several jurisdictions, including the Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, Vanuatu, and the Bahamas, already have zero capital gains tax on crypto. Singapore, Malaysia, and the UAE also impose zero capital gains tax on investors. Tax residents in European countries like Germany and Portugal can also avoid capital gains entirely if they hold their assets for a year. US Senate Passes GENIUS Act The US Senate passed the GENIUS Act, clearing the way for the creation of a regulatory framework for US dollar-pegged crypto-tokens known as stablecoins. The bill received bipartisan support, with several Democrats joining the Republicans to back the bill. As a result, it passed the Senate with a 68-30 vote. The bill must pass the House of Representatives before it heads to President Donald Trump for approval. Andrew Olmen, a managing partner at Mayer Brown, called the bill’s passage a major milestone, stating, “It is a major milestone. It establishes, for the first time, a regulatory regime for stablecoins, a rapidly developing financial product and industry.” If signed into law, the bill will mandate all stablecoins to be backed by liquid assets like the US Dollar and short-term Treasury Bills. Stablecoin issuers will also be required to disclose the composition of their reserves. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded during the ongoing session, with the price up nearly 1%. The flagship cryptocurrency has reclaimed $105,000 after registering significant declines on Monday and Tuesday as market sentiment worsened thanks to escalating tensions in the Middle East. BTC saw a sharp drop on Monday as markets turned bearish after reports emerged that President Donald Trump had called his advisors to the Situation Room. Tensions in the Middle East have escalated further, with President Trump leaving the G7 summit early and requesting the National Security Council meet in the White House Situation Room. Trump posted a chilling message on Truth Social after leaving the G7 summit, asking everyone to evacuate Tehran. US Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Trump’s departure due to the escalating Middle East conflict. “Much was accomplished, but because of what’s going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight after dinner with Heads of State.” Price action remained bearish on Tuesday as hopes of a quick resolution to the conflict evaporated. The Federal Reserve’s impending decision on rate cuts has also impacted investor sentiment. As a result, crypto liquidations have also surged by 25% in the past 24 hours to nearly $360 million. Markets were further spooked after two oil tankers collided and caught fire in the Strait of Hormuz, a critical area that sees millions of oil barrels pass daily. As a result, oil prices spiked, rising over 2%. Bitfinex analysts believe BTC must hold above $102,000 to stay on course for a potential rebound. According to the analysts, while BTC still risks falling further, if it stays above $102,000, it would suggest markets are absorbing the selling pressure effectively. However, downside risk lingers thanks to macroeconomic volatility and tensions between Israel and Iran. However, the market situation also presents investors with a high-stakes yet potentially rewarding opportunity for investors. Crypto trader Matthew Hyland stated on X, “This environment now reflects a high-risk, high-reward opportunity for upside continuation if buyer confidence returns.” Markets were optimistic about BTC testing its all-time high after it surged past $110,000 last week. However, those hopes were dashed after Israel carried out airstrikes on Iran. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs continued to see strong inflows despite market uncertainty. BTC entered the previous weekend on a bullish note, surging nearly 3% to settle at $104,378. Buyers retained control over the weekend as the price rose $1.15% on Saturday and registered a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC surged over 4% to cross the 20-day SMA and $110,000 and settle at $110,251. The price fell to an intraday low of $108,335 on Tuesday but recovered to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,253.

Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell nearly 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,828. The price plunged to an intraday low of $102,832 on Friday. However, it rebounded from this level to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,106. Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC dropped 0.59% on Saturday before registering a marginal increase on Sunday to settle at $105,562. BTC started the week positively as it raced to an intraday high of $108,944. However, sentiment changed as markets turned bearish. As a result, it dropped to settle at $106,806, ultimately registering an increase of 1.18%. Price action turned bearish on Tuesday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to $104,518. The current session sees BTC marginally up as buyers look to reclaim $105,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) remains sluggish as the week goes on, failing to establish itself above $2,600. ETH has traded primarily in the red since reaching a high of $2,878 on Wednesday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level as sellers overwhelmed buyers. As a result, ETH plunged to a low of $2,441 by Friday before recovering to reclaim $2,500. The price rallied to a high of $2,680 on Monday, but sentiment flipped thanks to growing geopolitical tensions, pushing ETH to a low of $2,455 by Tuesday. Analysts believe mega-whales are reinforcing further downside pressure by selling their holdings. However, addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH have steadily increased their holdings. CryptoQuant analysts believe ETH could recover if it decisively reclaims the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA). “The only thing holding ETH back.” ETH started the previous weekend with an increase of almost 3%, rising to $2,479. The price continued to push higher on Saturday, rising nearly 2% to cross $2,500 and settle at $2,525. Despite the positive sentiment, it was back in the red on Sunday, dropping 0.57% to end the weekend at $2,511. Bullish sentiment returned on Monday as ETH surged nearly 7%, crossing the 20 and 200-day SMAs and $2,600 to settle at $2,680.

Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana’s (SOL) decline intensified on Tuesday as it dipped below $150 to a low of $145 thanks to growing macroeconomic concerns and escalating geopolitical tensions. SOL rallied on Sunday but lost momentum on Monday as market sentiment worsened exponentially. Even the news of VanEck’s Solana ETF getting a DTCC listing failed to lift spirits, with the price continuing to struggle during the ongoing session. SOL traded in positive territory the previous weekend, rising 2.47% on Friday and settling at $147 after reaching an intraday high of $152. Price action remained positive on Saturday and Sunday, increasing 1.51% and 1.56% to reclaim $150 and settle at $152.

The RSI near 40.12 hints at the lack of strong momentum for a recovery. It is worth mentioning that a breakout above $170 could trigger a rally toward the $185 to $190 resistance zone.

Larry Cermak, who has served as CEO since March 2023 and has been with The Block for nearly seven years, will transition to the role of President. In this new capacity, he will focus full-time on advancing research and data capabilities as well as product innovation — areas where his expertise has been instrumental in establishing The Block’s reputation as the industry’s most trusted source of information. Kaleb Jessee, who has played a key leadership role as Chief Revenue Officer—driving B2B and B2C revenue growth across the Campus learning platform as well as sponsorship and research sales—will succeed Cermak as Chief Executive Officer. The leadership evolution also includes key editorial changes designed to strengthen The Block’s content operations. Tim Copeland, previously Editor-in-Chief, has transitioned to Head of Growth, where he will spearhead initiatives to expand The Block’s global reach and market impact. Adam James has been appointed Editor-in-Chief, ensuring continuity in The Block’s commitment to editorial excellence and journalistic integrity. Cermak assumed the CEO role during one of the most challenging periods in The Block’s history, when the company faced significant financial and operational difficulties. Under his leadership, The Block underwent a comprehensive business transformation that not only stabilized operations but positioned the company for sustainable long-term growth. “I stepped into the CEO role when it was necessary for the company’s survival,” said Cermak. “What I’ve truly missed is being close to research, data, and product development — where I can make the biggest impact. This transition allows me to focus on my core strengths and where I can drive the most value for our audience and the broader digital asset community.” During his tenure as CEO, Cermak successfully guided the company through a comprehensive transformation, including leading The Block’s sale to Foresight Ventures, launching new products like the Campus education platform, and establishing strategic partnerships such as a joint venture with Wintermute that created crypto index provider GMCI. Jessee brings extensive operational expertise and a proven track record of revenue growth to his new role as CEO. His deep understanding of The Block’s business model and strategic vision positions him to lead the company’s next phase of expansion. “The Block is entering an exciting new chapter, but our fundamental mission remains unchanged,” said Jessee. “We remain unwavering in our commitment to delivering world-class journalism, unrivaled research, and innovative learning experiences. I’m honored to lead this incredible team as we continue to set the standard for digital asset information and analysis.” Jessee’s promotion reflects The Block’s commitment to operational excellence and strategic growth. His background in managing complex revenue streams and building scalable business platforms aligns with the company’s objectives to expand its global footprint. “This transition reflects our maturation as an organization and our confidence in the long-term growth trajectory of crypto in the U.S.,” added Cermak. “By having someone who thrives on operational leadership in the CEO role, we’re optimizing our leadership structure for maximum impact.” About The Block The Block is the leading source of crypto-native news, research and data. Its beating heart is an editorial team that produces reliable and accurate reporting, bolstered by an expert-led team of researchers.

According to Arkham Intelligence data, on June 17, BlackRock purchased $250 million worth of Bitcoin ( BTC ). The acquisition is part of a broader accumulation streak that has now spanned six consecutive days, bringing the firm’s total Bitcoin investment during this period to $1.4 billion. BLACKROCK BUY STREAK: $1.4 BILLION OF BTC FOR 6 DAYS STRAIGHT BlackRock bought over $250M of BTC today, bringing their streak up to $1.4 Billion. BlackRock has now bought BTC for 6 days in a row. pic.twitter.com/VjbtlcSGk9 — Arkham (@arkham) June 17, 2025 The buying spree comes alongside a wave of inflows into BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has consistently led all spot Bitcoin ETFs in net inflows over the past week. On the same day as its latest BTC purchase, IBIT recorded approximately $639.2 million in net inflows, even as other major issuers like Fidelity, ARK, and Bitwise posted significant outflows. The strong influx of funds and steady buying also follow a major milestone for IBIT, which recently became the fastest exchange-traded fund in history to surpass $70 billion in assets under management (AUM). The fund reached that mark in just 341 days, crushing the previous record of 1,691 days set by the SPDR Gold Shares ETF.

The token has entered a consolidation phase following a rally earlier this week and is testing key support amid mounting ETF optimism. Market sentiment remains broadly neutral-to-positive: on-chain activity and ecosystem growth support confidence, even as geopolitical jitters trigger short-term volatility. In times when many altcoins are struggling to find a base, Solana is quietly attracting major investor attention. As per some reports, nearly $135 million worth of assets has been bridged from the other chains to Solana in the past 7 days. This also includes more than $70 million from Ethereum alone. This also suggests the growing cross-chain confidence and increasing utility. Ethereum-to-Solana flows leading the charge underscore shifting liquidity trends. This could be a major bullish signal for the SOL price ahead of the ETF approval. Solana Sustains Within a Bullish Structure Over the past couple of days, the SOL price has been facing huge bearish pressure as the sell-offs escalate, bringing the price close to $145. The token is forming consecutive lower highs and lows, hence displaying the rising dominance of the bears. Although the token is believed to maintain a descending trend and reach out to the local support, it remains within a huge bullish pattern. As seen in the above chart, the SOL price is trading within a massive cup & handle pattern wherein the selling pressure is yet to fade. Besides, the CMF has remained stuck below the average since the start of the month, suggesting no major money flow into the token. On the other hand, the RSI is heading towards the lower threshold, dragging the SOL price close to $143 or $140, which could act as a base to trigger a rebound. If it fails to do so, the price may test the support of the channel at $133, which is one of the most pivotal ranges. Therefore, the hopes for a strong upswing continue to remain high for the Solana (SOL) price rally as long as the support at $133 is held strongly.",https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/institutions-stack-solana-ahead-of-sol-etf-will-this-be-the-catalyst-for-the-price-to-reach-1000/,Price Analysis|Altcoins

OpenPayd, a financial infrastructure provider that processes more than €130 billion annually, has partnered with Circle, the issuer of USD Coin ( USDC ). The partnership will let OpenPayd’s clients easily send and manage money worldwide using both traditional banks and blockchain networks. By leveraging Circle’s scalable, programmable stablecoin infrastructure and wallets, OpenPayd’s clients can quickly convert between regular currencies and USDC, gaining faster access to funds, lower fees, and new ways to handle payments, treasury, and digital assets. “Stablecoins will be foundational to the next era of financial services, and our partnership with Circle positions us, and our clients, at the centre of that transformation,” said Iana Dimitrova, chief executive of OpenPayd. You might also like: iPhone moment incoming? Circle CEO says stablecoins are almost there The development is part of Circle’s ongoing efforts to broaden USDC’s adoption and real-world use. Most notably, Circle recently integrated its stablecoin natively on the XRP Ledger, allowing developers, institutions, and users to access it directly on the network, without resorting to bridging. In another major development, Circle partnered with Latin America’s largest digital bank, Nubank, to launch a 4% annual rewards program for USDC holders at the start of this year. Nubank noted that more than 50% of new crypto users on its platform chose USDC as their first digital asset. Despite these ongoing efforts to increase USDC adoption, some early investors have already begun offloading Circle’s shares following its IPO. Ark Invest sold shares in two consecutive rounds — offloading $51.7 million on June 16 and another $44.8 million on June 17 across its ARKK, ARKW, and ARKF funds. Additionally, some analysts argue that Circle’s shares are overvalued and will crash soon .

Key Takeaways: K33 is raising at least $9 million to buy Bitcoin and strengthen its balance sheet. The firm aims to reach a 1,000 BTC target as part of its broader treasury strategy. Direct Bitcoin holdings are expected to boost K33’s margins and attract institutional clients. The offering, managed by Pareto Securities AS, sets the share price at SEK 0.1036 and allows for an open-ended raise beyond the minimum amount, according to a Wednesday press release . The move is part of K33’s broader strategy to solidify its financial foundation and gain long-term exposure to Bitcoin, while enhancing its operational strength as a brokerage platform. K33 Advances Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy After May 28 Disclosure K33’s initiative follows a May 28 announcement detailing a dedicated BTC accumulation strategy. By holding Bitcoin directly, the firm aims to unlock operational leverage that would improve profit margins, enable new product lines, and bolster appeal to institutional partners. The company believes this approach will fuel scalable growth without exposing the acquired BTC to risk. The directed share issue offers quick access to capital, allowing K33 to respond swiftly to favorable market opportunities while bringing in strategically aligned investors. CEO Torbjørn Bull Jenssen said that the financing round marks a major step toward the company’s near-term target of acquiring 1,000 BTC. “We strongly believe that Bitcoin represents the future of global finance and are positioning K33 to benefit maximally from this,” said Jenssen. “A strong balance sheet built on Bitcoin enables us to significantly improve our brokerage operation while maintaining full exposure to Bitcoin’s upside potential.” The company has not set an upper limit for the raise, giving it flexibility to expand its BTC reserves further should demand from investors allow. The board retains the discretion to introduce a maximum offer size at a later stage.

VanEck Warns BTC Treasury Strategy May Backfire Just recently, VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, raised concerns about the Bitcoin treasury strategies used by certain public companies, suggesting that continued accumulation of BTC could soon harm shareholders more than help. He specifically criticized the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, warning that they can become dilutive when stock prices approach the company’s Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Sigel proposed several measures to prevent value erosion, including pausing ATM programs if a company’s stock trades below 0.95x NAV for over 10 days. He drew comparisons to past failures in the crypto mining sector, where excessive dilution and executive pay led to major shareholder losses. As an example, he cited Semler Scientific, a medical tech firm that entered the BTC space in 2024. Despite acquiring 3,808 BTC, its stock has fallen over 45%, and its mNAV has dropped to 0.82x.
